# 1. Atomic Structure, Periodic Table, Electronic Structure

**[1]**
**atom**: smallest unit of a substance; composed of a combination of 3 fundamental particles
- electrons
- protons
- neutrons

the combination of these particles is unique to each type of atom

An atom of the element radon is composed primarily of a specific combination of what three basic particles? **electrons, protons, and neutrons**

---

**[2]**
Atoms of the same element -> same proton & electron combination

An atom of the element hydrogen in outer space has **the same** combination of electrons and protons as that of an atom of hydrogen on earth.

**[3]**
Since each element has a known unique number of protons and electrons in its atoms, would it be possible to identify an element if you know the number of protons and electrons in its atoms? **yes; the number of protons and electrons in a specific kind of atom is unique**

**[4]**
protons: positively charged particles (+)  
electrons: negatively charged particles (-)  

unless state otherwise, atoms are electrically neutral 
- number of protons = number of electrons
- charges cancel out

An oxygen atom contains eight protons. We assume the atom to be neutral. How many electrons must it have? **8 electrons**

---

**[5]**
An atom contains 10 electrons. How many protons does it contain? **10 protons**

---

**[6]**
Each element has a unique number of electrons and protons in its atoms. Since the number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, do you think we can identify an element if we know just the number of protons in its atoms? **yes because the number of protons should be consistent across atoms of the same type**

**[7]**
**periodic table**: describes atoms of known elements
- each box represents an element
- one or two letter symbol: shorthand representation of atom

ex) C: carbon  
ex) H: hydrogen

![](.pastes\2021-07-02-10-13-30.png)

carbon has 6 protons  
How many protons does an atom of helium have? **2**

---

**[8]**
atomic number: number of protons in an atom  
What is the atomic number of the element helium (He)? **2**

---

**[9]**
The element iron (Fe) has an atomic number of 26. How many protons does an atom of iron contain? **26**

---

**[10]**
A neutral atom of iron contains how many electrons? **26 (same as the number of protons)**

---

**[11]**
Using the periodic table, determine the number of electrons in a neutral atom of zinc (Zn). **30 (same as the number of protons)**
