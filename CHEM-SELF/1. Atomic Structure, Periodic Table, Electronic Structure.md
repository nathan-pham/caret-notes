# 1. Atomic Structure, Periodic Table, Electronic Structure
**[1]**
**atom**: smallest unit of a substance; composed of a combination of 3 fundamental particles
- electrons
- protons
- neutrons

the combination of these particles is unique to each type of atom

An atom of the element radon is composed primarily of a specific combination of what three basic particles? **electrons, protons, and neutrons**

---

**[2]**
Atoms of the same element -> same proton & electron combination

An atom of the element hydrogen in outer space has **the same** combination of electrons and protons as that of an atom of hydrogen on earth.

---

**[3]**
Since each element has a known unique number of protons and electrons in its atoms, would it be possible to identify an element if you know the number of protons and electrons in its atoms? **yes; the number of protons and electrons in a specific kind of atom is unique**

---

**[4]**
protons: positively charged particles (+)  
electrons: negatively charged particles (-)  

unless state otherwise, atoms are electrically neutral 
- number of protons = number of electrons
- charges cancel out

An oxygen atom contains eight protons. We assume the atom to be neutral. How many electrons must it have? **8 electrons**

---

**[5]**
An atom contains 10 electrons. How many protons does it contain? **10 protons**

---

**[6]**
Each element has a unique number of electrons and protons in its atoms. Since the number of electrons in a neutral atom is equal to the number of protons, do you think we can identify an element if we know just the number of protons in its atoms? **yes because the number of protons should be consistent across atoms of the same type**

---

**[7]**
**periodic table**: describes atoms of known elements
- each box represents an element
- one or two letter symbol: shorthand representation of atom

ex) C: carbon  
ex) H: hydrogen

![](.pastes\2021-07-02-10-13-30.png)

carbon has 6 protons  
How many protons does an atom of helium have? **2**

---

**[8]**
atomic number: number of protons in an atom  
What is the atomic number of the element helium (He)? **2**

---

**[9]**
The element iron (Fe) has an atomic number of 26. How many protons does an atom of iron contain? **26**

---

**[10]**
A neutral atom of iron contains how many electrons? **26 (same as the number of protons)**

---

**[11]**
Using the periodic table, determine the number of electrons in a neutral atom of zinc (Zn). **30 (same as the number of protons)**

## BOHR ATOMIC MODEL
**12**
Niels Bohr, a Danish physicist, created the Bohr model to represent atoms
- nucleus of protons in center
- electrons orbit 

![](..\.pastes\2021-07-02-10-25-46.png)

What is the atomic number of the element represented? **1 (atomic number = # of protons = # of electrons)**  
What element is represented? **hydrogen (H)**

---

**13**
An electron always carries a negative charge. A proton carries a charge exactly opposite that of the electron. A proton must therefore have a **positive** charge.

---

**14**
electrons have almost negligible mass
- 1/1836 of the weight of a proton

In a hydrogen atom consisting of just one proton and one electron, the greatest proportion by weight is accounted for by the **proton (99.95% of the hydrogen atom's weight)**.

---

**15**
The element helium (He), represented by the Bohr model below, has an atomic number of **2**.

![](..\.pastes\2021-07-02-10-31-36.png)

---

**16**
The neutral atom of He contains how many protons? **2**  
How many electrons? **2**  

---

**17**
**neutron** also adds weight  
most elements (except common hydrogen) have a few neutrons  

Since a neutral atom contains equal numbers of negatively charged electrons and positively charged protons, what type of electrical charge do you think is possessed by a neutron? **no charge, neutral particle**

![](..\.pastes\2021-07-02-10-38-35.png)

---

**18**
neutrons are slightly heavier than protons  
which is the lightest in weight? **electron**  
which is the heaviest? **neutron**  
which is between the other two in weight? **proton**  

---

**19**
In the Bohr model of a lithium atom shown below, which subatomic particle(s) is (are) represented by the circular orbits shown by the larger circles? **electrons**  
Which particle(s) make(s) up the nucleus or center of the atom? **protons and neutrons**

**20**
 If the negative charge of an electron is represented by âˆ’1, the charge on the proton would be **+1** and the charge on the neutron would be **neutral**.

**21**
Neutrons can be found in all atoms of all elements except the most common form of the simplest element. Identify that element. **hydrogen**

## PERIODIC TABLE
**22**
the shorthand symbol of an element represents a neutral atom  
ex) Ca: neutral atom of calcium  

Remembering the definition of a neutral atom, you know that Ca contains 20 protons and how many electrons? **20 electrons**

---

**23**
the periodic table is composed of rows and columns  
- **periods**: rows
- **groups**: columns (labeled in ascending order 1 - 18)

The elements Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, and Ra are included in which group? **Group 2 (IIA)**

---

**24**
The elements Li, Be, B, C, N, O, F, and Ne are all members of a **period**

---

**25**
groups are also called **families**
- elements within a family share similar chemical properties

Argon (Ar) is part of Group VIIIA. It is a rather unreactive gas. Since families or groups of elements have similar properties, would you expect krypton (Kr) to be a highly reactive gas? **no; krypton is in the same family and therefore is likely unreactive**

---

**26**
**noble gas family (group VIIIA)**: unreactive and gaseous at room temperature 

An element in Group VIIIA may be generalized by its family name as a **noble gas**.

---

**27**
**alkali metals (group IA, except hydrogen)**:  highly reactive with water, creates strong alkaline solutions

If a friend told you that aluminum (Al) was an alkali metal, would he be right or wrong? **wrong, aluminum is located in group IIIA**
