# Elements and Atoms
substances have different properties (color, melting point, interactions with other substances, form of matter)

**elements**: pure substances
- ex) carbon, lead, gold
- represented on the periodic table

**atom**: smallest unit of an element that still retains its properties
- defined by arrangement of fundamental particles: proton, electron, neutron
- number of protons determines the element (= **atomic number**)

atoms are assumed to be neutral unless stated; same number of electrons & protons

**nucleus**: contains protons (number defines element) & neutrons (number can vary within element)
- protons: positive charge
- neutrons: no charge
- electrons: negative charge

electrons are attracted to the nucleus but they can be transferred or shared with other atoms of other elements
