# Average Atomic Mass
**atomic mass unit (amu)**: helps measure at the atomic scale, deprecated in favor of a **Dalton (Da)** or **unified atomic mass unit (u)**
- u = 1.660540 X 10^(-27) kg
- about the same mass of a proton or neutron

proton ≈ 1.007 u
neutron ≈ 1.008 u
electron ≈ 1 / 2000 of a proton

**average atomic mass**: mass number on periodic table is a weighted average of the mass of isotopes
- relative atomic mass: unitless, describes mass of atoms relative to each other
- ex) a carbon atom is roughly 12x the weight of a hydrogen atom
