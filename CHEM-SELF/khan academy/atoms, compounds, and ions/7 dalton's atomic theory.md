# Dalton's Atomic Theory
**Dalton's atomic theory**: describes matter in terms of atoms, based on 
- **law of conservation of mass**: all matter is made of indivisible atoms, it cannot be created nor destroyed
- **law of constant composition**: all atoms of an element are identical in mass and properties
- compounds are made of a combination of atoms
- chemical reactions are the rearrangement of atoms

## Basis for Dalton's Theory
**law of conservation of mass**: in a closed system, matter is not created nor destroyed
- chemical reactions only rearrange the starting materials, the amount of material is still the same in the product
- balance equations

**law of constant composition**: pure compounds will have the same proportion of the same elements
- ex) salt contains the same proportions of NaCl, regardless where the sodium came from

ex) A time-travelling scientist from the early 1700s decides to run the following experiment: he takes a 10 gram sample of ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) and burns it in the presence of oxygen in an open beaker. After the reaction is done, the beaker is empty. Does this result violate the law of conservation of mass?
No, the beaker is open and therefore does not accurately represent the law of conservation of mass.
