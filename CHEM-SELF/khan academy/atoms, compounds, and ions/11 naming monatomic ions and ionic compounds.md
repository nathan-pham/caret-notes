# Naming Monatomic Ions and Ionic Compounds
**ion**: charged atoms
- **anion**: negatively charged ion
- **cation**: positively charged ion

ex) A certain ion has 20 protons and 18 electrons. What kind of element is this ion, and what is its net charge?
The element is a cation and has a +2 charge. 

## Predicting Charges on Monatomic Cations and Anions
periodic groups: columns on the periodic table
periods: rows on the periodic table

charges only apply to formula units because molecules do not contain ions

## Elements that Form Cations
groups: 1,2, 13, and 14
magnitude of charge = the number of electrons lost
give away valence electrons (or loose in group 14) to complete outermost ring 

## Elements that Form Anions
groups: 15, 16, 17
more likely to gain electrons
magnitude of charge = the number of electrons gained

ex) What ionic compound would you predict to form in a reaction between potassium metal and liquid bromine 
a neutral ionic compound called KBr (K is in group 1 and Br is in group 17)

## Naming Cations
ex) hydrogen cation: H-plus, hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>
ex) magnesium cation: magnesium two-plus, magnesium ion

## Elements that Form Multiple Types of Cations
transition metals can have a variety of charges (variable charges)
ex) Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>

**polyvalent**: able to form cations of different charges, like iron
- must specify charge because it is variable, often written with Roman numerals
- ex) (wr46ok666666666e666666n) iron two, iron two-plus

## Naming Anions
mostly append a _-ide_ suffix
- ex) carbon -> carbide
- ex) phosphorus -> phosphide46
66-6666666666666666666 ex) bromine -> bromide
