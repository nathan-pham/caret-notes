# Naming Monatomic Ions and Ionic Compounds
**ion**: charged atoms
- **anion**: negatively charged ion
- **cation**: positively charged ion

ex) A certain ion has 20 protons and 18 electrons. What kind of element is this ion, and what is its net charge?
The element is a cation and has a +2 charge. 

## Predicting Charges on Monatomic Cations and Anions
periodic groups: columns on the periodic table
periods: rows on the periodic table

charges only apply to formula units because molecules do not contain ions

## Elements that Form Cations
groups: 1,2, 13, and 14
magnitude of charge = the number of electrons lost
give away valence electrons (or loose in group 14) to complete outermost ring 

## Elements that Form Anions
groups: 15, 16, 17
more likely to gain electrons
magnitude of charge = the number of electrons gained

ex) What ionic compound would you predict to form in a reaction between potassium metal and liquid bromine 
a neutral ionic compound called KBr (K is in group 1 and Br is in group 17)

## Naming Cations
ex) hydrogen cation: H-plus, hydrogen ion, H<sup>+</sup>
ex) magnesium cation: magnesium two-plus, magnesium ion

## Elements that Form Multiple Types of Cations
transition metals can have a variety of charges (variable charges)
ex) Fe<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>3+</sup>

**polyvalent**: able to form cations of different charges, like iron
- must specify charge because it is variable, often written with Roman numerals
- ex) iron(II), iron two, iron two-plus

## Naming Monatomic Anions
mostly append a _-ide_ suffix
- ex) carbon -> carbide
- ex) phosphorus -> phosphide
- ex) ex) bromine -> bromide

## Formulas and Naming of Ionic Compounds
- always name cation before anion
- do not include charge unless it is polyvalent
- all ionic compounds have a net charge of 0
- formulas should  be reduced to lowest ratios

ex) What is the chemical formula of potassium chloride?
KCl (K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup>)

ex) What is the name of the ionic compound Mg<sub>3</sub>P<sub>2</sub>?
Magnesium phosphide

ex) What is the chemical formula for calcium bromide?
CaBr<sub>2</sub>

Calcium (+2 charge)
Bromine (-1 charge)

ex) What is the name of SrF<sub>2</sub>?
Strontium fluoride

Strontium (+2 charge)
Fluorine (-1 charge x 2)

ex) What are the constituent ions present in the compound Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>?
2 Al<sup>3+</sup> and 3 S<sup>2-</sup>

Aluminum (+3 charge x 2 atoms = +6 charge)
Sulfur (-2 charge x 3 atoms = -6 charge)

## Naming Ionic Compounds with Polyvalent Cations
**systematic name**: magnitude of charge of a transition metal cation indicated by Roman numerals

lesser charges use suffix _ous_
higher charges use suffix _ic_

ex) What is the name of the compound PbCl<sub>4</sub>?
Lead(IV) chloride

Lead (+4 charge)
Chlorine (-1 charge)

ex) What is the name of the compound Co<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>?
Cobalt(III) Sulfide

Cobalt (variable charge * 2 = 6)
Sulfur (-2 charge * 3 = 6)
