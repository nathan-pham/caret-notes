# Isotopes and Mass Spectrometry
## Key Points
**isotopes**: same number of protons but different number of neutrons
- isotopes of the same element have different atomic masses

**relative abundance**: percent of atoms with _n_ atomic mass in a naturally occurring sample of an element
- determined by **mass spectrometry**
- ionizes atoms with high-energy electron beam and deflects ions through a magnetic field based on mass-to-charge ratio (_m/z_)
- mass spectrum shows relative abundance (y-axis) and _m/z ratio_ or u (x-axis)

**average atomic mass**: weighted average; sum of all relative abundances of an isotope x atomic mass

## Dissecting an Atom
atom: building blocks of matter
subatomic particles: make up the atom; protons, electrons, and neutrons
- proton carries +1 charge
- electron carries -1 charge
- neutron carries 0 charge

protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus
electron is attracted to the positive charge & "orbits" nucleus

contains 2 protons, 2 electrons, and 2 neutrons

**isotopes**: atoms of the same element with a varying number of neutrons; retains identity and characteristics 
- derived from _iso_: same, _tope_: place
- isotopes of an element still have the same number of protons; same place on periodic table (though varying neutrons results in unique atomic mass)

## Particle Masses and Unified Atomic Mass Units
**unified atomic mass unit (u)**: conceptualize mass at atomic scales
1 u = 1/2 of the mass of neutral carbon-12 (hyphen notation)

ex) How many protons are in the nucleus of an atom of carbon-12?
There are 6 protons in carbon-12

electron has a much smaller relative mass compared to the protons & neutrons of an atom; has a near negligible effect on atomic mass

## Mass Number and Isotope Notation
**mass number** = number of protons + number of neutrons
- useful in defining the isotope of an element

ex) Chromium-52 is the most stable isotope of chromium. How many neutrons are found in a single atom of chromium-52?
52 mass number - 24 protons = 28 neutrons

**isotopic notation**:: atomic number, mass number, charge of isotope, chemical symbol (net charge not included for neutral atoms)

## Atomic Mass vs Mass Number
very closely related because the mass of protons & neutrons is roughly 1 u
- mass number is the count of particles in the nucleus; it is always an integer
- atomic mass contains a unit of mass (u) and is usually not an integer
