# Isotopes and Mass Spectrometry
## Key Points
**isotopes**: same number of protons but different number of neutrons
- isotopes of the same element have different atomic masses

**relative abundance**: percent of atoms with _n_ atomic mass in a naturally occurring sample of an element
- determined by **mass spectrometry**
- ionizes atoms with high-energy electron beam and deflects ions through a magnetic field based on mass-to-charge ratio (_m/z_)
- mass spectrum shows relative abundance (y-axis) and _m/z ratio_ or u (x-axis)

**average atomic mass**: weighted average; sum of all relative abundances of an isotope x atomic mass

## Dissecting an Atom
atom: building blocks of matter
subatomic particles: make up the atom; protons, electrons, and neutrons
- proton carries +1 charge
- electron carries -1 charge
- neutron carries 0 charge

protons and neutrons are found in the nucleus
electron is attracted to the positive charge & "orbits" nucleus

contains 2 protons, 2 electrons, and 2 neutrons

**isotopes**: atoms of the same element with a varying number of neutrons; retains identity and characteristics 
- derived from _iso_: same, _tope_: place
- isotopes of an element still have the same number of protons; same place on periodic table (though varying neutrons results in unique atomic mass)

## Particle Masses and Unified Atomic Mass Units
**unified atomic mass unit (u)**: conceptualize mass at atomic scales
1 u = 1/2 of the mass of neutral carbon-12 (hyphen notation)

ex) How many protons are in the nucleus of an atom of carbon-12?
There are 6 protons in carbon-12

electron has a much smaller relative mass compared to the protons & neutrons of an atom; has a near negligible effect on atomic mass

## Mass Number and Isotope Notation
**mass number** = number of protons + number of neutrons
- useful in defining the isotope of an element

ex) Chromium-52 is the most stable isotope of chromium. How many neutrons are found in a single atom of chromium-52?
52 mass number - 24 protons = 28 neutrons

**isotopic notation**:: atomic number, mass number, charge of isotope, chemical symbol (net charge not included for neutral atoms)

## Atomic Mass vs Mass Number
very closely related because the mass of protons & neutrons is roughly 1 u
- mass number is the count of particles in the nucleus; it is always an integer
- atomic mass contains a unit of mass (u) and is usually not an integer

## Relative Abundance and Average Atomic Mass
all masses on periodic table are averages based on atomic mass and natural abundance of an element's (stable) isotopes
- referred to as **average atomic mass (atomic weight)**
- weighted average of relative abundance and atomic mass

**relative abundance**: describes how some isotopes are more naturally occurring on Earth than others

ex) chlorine-35 has a relative abundance of 75.76%, chlorine-37 has a relative abundance of 24.24%

![](..\..\..\.pastes\2021-07-11-19-23-12.png)
chlorine average atomic mass: (0.7576 x 34.97 u) + (0.2424 × 36.97 u)
= 26.49 u + 8.96 u
= 35.45 u

ex) Bromine has two stable isotopes—bromine-79 and bromine-81 . The relative abundance of the isotopes are 50.70% and 49.30% respectively. Is the atomic weight of bromine closest to 79, 80, or 81?
The average atomic mass is likely closer to 80 u (actual is 79.90 u).

## Mass Spectrometry

1. sample is injected into a mass spectrometer as an aqueous solution
2. vaporized by a heater
3. bombard solution with electrons -> creates positively charged ions
4. ions are accelerated through electric fields
5. deflected by magnetic fields and interpreted by a detector

amount of ion deflection is determined by speed and charge
- heaver ions are deflected less, lighter ions more
- higher charged ions are deflected more, lower less
- inversely proportional to the **mass-to-charge ratio (m/z)** (lower means deflected more, higher means deflected less)

detector measures m/z ratio and number of ions per ratio
- relative abundance = ions of a particular ratio / total ions detected
- mass spectrum: plots relative abundance to mass-to-charge ratio

ex) A sample of copper is injected into a mass spectrometer. After the sample is vaporized and ionized, the ions <sup>63</sup>Cu<sup>2+</sup> and <sup>65</sup>Cu<sup>2+</sup> are detected. Which ion is deflected more inside the spectrometer?
<sup>63</sup>Cu<sup>2+</sup> is deflected more in the spectrometer

## Analyzing the Mass Spectrum of Zirconium
![](..\..\..\.pastes\2021-07-11-19-42-56.png)
5 naturally occurring isotopes of zirconium
x-axis was labeled as atomic mass, means all ions had a +1 charge

ex) Based on this spectrum, what is the most common naturally occurring isotope of zirconium?
Based on the spectrum, zicronium-90 is the most common isotope

calculating average atomic mass: (89.905 * 0.5145) + (90.906 * 0.1122) + (91.905 * 0.1715) + (93.906 * 0.1738) + (95.908 * 0.0280) = 91.22377 u
