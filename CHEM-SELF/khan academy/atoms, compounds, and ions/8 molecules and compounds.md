# Molecules and Compounds
compound: group of atoms held by chemical bonds
stability of chemical bonds depends on electrostatic attractions 

major types of bonds
1. covalent bonds: 2 atoms share electrons
2. ionic bonds: electrons are fully transferred; forms ions

## Covalent Bonds and Molecules
stability comes from electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the shared negatively charged electrons

molecule: simplest unit of a covalent compound

## Chemical (Molecular) Formulas
simplest way to represent molecules
elemental symbols indicate the presence of atoms and subscripts indicate the amount of each element

ex) NH<sub>3</sub> (ammonia): contains 1 nitrogen and 3 hydrogen

ex) The chemical formula for acetic acid, a common acid found in vinegar, is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. How many oxygen atoms are there in three molecules of acetic acid?
There are 6 oxygen atoms in 3 molecules of acetic acid.

molecular shape -> trigonal pyramidal (caused by the repulsion between the hydrogen atoms and lone electrons on top of nitrogen; see the 3D structural formula)
space-filing model shows relative sizes of atoms
ball-and-stick model shows covalent bonds
