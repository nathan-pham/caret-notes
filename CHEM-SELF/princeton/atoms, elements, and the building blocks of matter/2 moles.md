# Moles
bridges atomic quantities to world calculations (like grams)

## Moles and Molecules
**Avogadro's Number**: how many atoms are in a mole 
- always 6.02 x 10 ^ 23
- counts extraordinarily small things (atoms, molecules, ions)

1 mole = 6.02 x 10 ^ 23 particles
moles = particles / 6.022 x 10 ^ 23

## Moles and Grams
periodic table atomic mass
- measured by atomic mass units (amu or u)
- also represents how many grams in one mole 

moles = grams / molar mass

## Moles and Gases
ideal gas equation: calculate the number of moles in a gas
PV = nRT; where n stands for moles of gas
- P = pressure (atm)
- V = volume (L)
- T = temperature (K)
- R = the gas constant, 0.0821 L * atom / mol * K

STP: standard temperature and pressure
- P = 1 atm
- T = 273 K
- one mole of gas at STP = 22.4 L

moles = liters / 22.4 L / mol

## Molarity (Molar Concentration)
molarity (M) describes solution concentration in volume
ex) [Na+] = molarity of sodium ions

molarity (M) = moles of solute / liters of solution

## Percent Composition
percent mass of each element in a compound
mass of each element or component / total molar mass

ex) calculate percent composition of each element in calcium nitrate
Ca(NO3)2
1. multiply number of atoms by molar mass
calcium = 1 * 40.08 = 40.08 g / mol 
nitrogen = 2 * 14.01 = 28.02 g / mol
oxygen = 6 * 16.00 = 96.00 g / mol

2. sum all molar masses
40.08 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 164.10 g / mol

3. divide atomic molar mass by total molar mass
Ca: 40.08 / 164.10 = 24.42%
N: 28.02 / 164.10 = 17.07%
O: 96.00 / 164.10 = 58.50%

## Empirical and Molecular Formulas
empirical formula: reduced molecular formula; simplest ratio
molecular formula: actual number of atoms in the substance

ex) a compound contains 
56.5% carbon
7.11% hydrogen
36.4% phosphorus.

a) find the empirical formula
1. assume a 100 gram sample to convert percent -> grams
C: 56.5 g C x 1 mol C / 12. 0 1 g C = 4.71 mol C
H: 7.11 g H x 1 mol H / 1.01 g H = 7.04 mol H
P: 36.4 g P x 1 mol P / 30.97 g P = 1.18 mol P

2. divide all molar masses by the smallest atomic molar mass (round to the nearest atom)
C: 4.71 mol / 1.18 mol = 4
H: 7.04 mol / 1.18 mol = 6
P: 1.18 mol  /1.18 mol = 1

3. write empirical formula
C4 H6 P1

b) find the molecular formula if the compound has a molar mass of 
170.14 g / mol
1. find molar mass of empirical formula
(12.01 * 4) + (1.01 * 6) + (30.97 * 1) = 85.07 g / mol
x = 170.14 / 85.07 = 2

1. scale each atom in the empirical formula by x
C4 H6 P1 = C8 H12 P2

## Electron Configurations and the Periodic Table
positively charged nucleus draws negatively charged electrons

electron potential energy increases with distance from the nucleus
**quantized**: electron energy exists at discrete (not continuous) levels
