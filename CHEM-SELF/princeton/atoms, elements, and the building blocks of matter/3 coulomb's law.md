# Coulomb's Law
Coulomb's Law helps calculate the energy level of an electron

E = k(+q)(-q) / r^2
- E = energy
- k = Coulomb's constant
- (+q) = magnitude of positive charge (nucleus)
- (-q) = magnitude of the negative charge (electron)
- r = distance between charges

qualitative observations:
greater nucleus charges = all electrons will have more energy
Coulombic potential energy = 0 @ r = infinity
potential energy of a 1s electron < potential energy of a 3s electron
- removing a 1s electron requires more electron
- binding energy: energy needed to remove an electron and bring the Coulombic potential energy of the electron to 0; will always be positive

## The Bohr Model
Neils Bohr used quantum theory to predict electron orbital shells

each row on the periodic table represents an energy level, from n = 1 to n = 7
closer energy levels = less potential electron energy

atoms absorb energy in the form of **electromagnetic radiation**; electrons jump to higher energy levels
atoms give off energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation; electrons drop to lower energy levels

describes energy and electromagnetic radiation:
E = hv
- E = energy change (in Joules / atom)
- h = Planck's constant (6.626 x 10^-34 J s)
- v = frequency (in s^-1)

frequency and wavelength of electromagnetic radiation are inversely proportional
higher frequency and smaller wavelengths = more energy
c = λv
- C = speed of light (2.998 x 10^8 ms^-1)
- v = frequency (in s^-1)
- λ = wavelength (in m, remember to convert since most waves are in nm)

ex) 350 nm * (1 x 10 ^-9 m) / 1 nm = 3.50 x 10^-7 m

ex) How much energy does light with a wavelength of 695 nm have?
