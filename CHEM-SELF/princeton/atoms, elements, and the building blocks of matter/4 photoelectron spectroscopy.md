# Photoelectron Spectroscopy
**ionization energy (binding energy)**: electromagnetic radiation exceeding the binding energies of that atom; causes electrons to be ejected from the atom
- ionization energy is usually measured in electron volts (1 eV = 1.6 x 10^-19 Joules) for singular atoms
- ionization atoms is usually measured in kJ / mol or MJ / mol for moles of atoms

all energy is conserved; energy that is not used to break the electron free is converted into kinetic energy for the ejected electron
- incoming radiation = binding energy + kinetic energy (of ejected electron)
- electrons further from the nucleus have greater potential energy = require less energy to eject = greater kinetic energy = greater movement speed
- speed of ejected electrons can be used to calculate its initial energy level/distance from the nucleus of the atom

atoms usually absorb visible or UV to cause electron ejection
infrared is used to study chemical bonds
microwave is used to study molecular shape

## Spectra
**photoelectron spectra (PES)** charts ionization energy for all electrons

photoelectron spectra for sulfur
y-axis: relative number of electrons ejected at a given energy level
x-axis: descending; represents a binding/ionization energy 

each peak represents an energy level; PES indicates that electrons at that same energy level are not the same distance from the nucleus 
- Bohr model is 2D and cannot represent the 3D **subshells** that represent the area an electron can exist in
- relative heights shown in the PES help reveal the electrons per subshell

s-subshell: first subshell; holds 2 electrons max
p-subshell: holds 6 electrons max
d-subshell: holds 10 electrons max
f-subshell: holds 14 electrons max

## Electron Configuration

periodic table is organized to align with subshells
- s-block: first two groups + helium
- p-block: right of the s-block
- d-block: transition metals
- f-block: inner transition metals

**electron configuration**: description of energy levels and subshells that each electron on an element inhabits

note: energy levels drop by one with the d-block (transition metals)

ex) what is the electron configuration of sulfur?
sulfur: 16 electrons

ex) what is the electron configuration of nickel?

electron configurations also have a shorthand by replacing all of the previous energy levels with the symbol of a [noble gas]
