# Periodic Trends
you can predict the characteristics of atoms with the periodic table

1. negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus
   a. electrons closer the nucleus are more strongly attracted
   b. electrons are more strongly attracted in the presence of more protons in the nucleus
2. electrons are repelled by other electrons; valence electrons are less attracted to the nucleus because in-between electrons **shield** it
3. completed shells (and subshells) are stable

metals: lose electrons to form bonds
non-metals: gain electrons to form bonds
metalloids: borderline between metal and non-metals (silicon, arsenic)

**atomic radius**: distance from nucleus to valence electrons
- _atomic radius decreases moving left to right across periods_ (protons are added more quickly and attract electrons more strongly; shielding is less present)
- _atomic radius increases down a group_ (each electron shields the next layer, valence electrons get farther from the nucleus)

_cations are smaller than atoms_ because they lose their outermost shell and decrease electron-electron repulsions (valence electrons move closer to nucleus)
_anions are larger than atoms_ because they complete their outermost shell and increase electron-electron repulsions (valence electrons drift further from the nucleus)

**ionization energy**: 1st ionization energy (energy required to remove an electron), 2nd ionization energy (energy required to remove the next electron)
- _ionization energy increases moving left to right across a period_ (valence electrons are closer and are more strongly attracted to the nucleus)
- _ionization energy decreases moving a group_ (valence electrons are farther and less strongly attracted to the nucleus)

_second ionization energy is greater than first ionization energy_ (electron-electron repulsions decrease, causing the valence electrons to be more strongly attracted to the nucleus)
- increases until a shell is empty and then makes a massive jump (when the valence shell is emptied, the next electron must come from an electron at a lower level; makes ionization energy drastically increase)]

ex) Chlorine has a first ionization energy of 1251 kJ/mol. What wavelength of light would be necessary to ionize a single atom of chlorine?

### Electronegativity
electronegativity: how strongly the nucleus attracts neighboring electrons
- nuclear charge will extend past the outermost shell in small atoms (greater electronegativity)
- atoms with more complete electron shells will exerts greater pull on necessary electrons (greater electronegativity)

electronegativity increases moving from left to right across a period
electronegativity decreases moving down a group

helium, neon, and argon have 0 electronegativity
large noble gases can form bonds depending on the condition

**across a period**
- atomic radius decreases
- ionization energy increases
- electronegativity increases

**down a group**
- atomic radius increases
- ionization energy decreases
- electronegativity decreases
