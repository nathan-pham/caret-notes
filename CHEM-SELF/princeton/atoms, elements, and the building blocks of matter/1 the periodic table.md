# The Periodic Table
displays the atomic number, symbol, and molar mass of each element

**periods**: horizontal rows
**groups**: vertical columns
- group 1: Alkali Metals
- group 2: Alkali Earth Metals
- group 12: Transition Metals
- group 17: Halogens
- group 18: Noble Gases

lanthanides and actinides: rare Earth elements, inner transition metals

atoms are defined by the number of protons
atomic mass is the sum of neutrons and protons; electrons are considered massless when compared to larger particles

**isotopes**: differ in the number of neutrons
- ex) carbon-12: contains 6 protons and 6 neutrons
- ex) carbon-14: contains 6 protons and 8 neutrons
- molar mass on the periodic table is a weighted average of isotopes based on their percent abundance

mass spectrometry: determines the mass of the isotopes of an element
molar mass is usually a good indicator of the most common isotope 
- ex) molar mass of carbon is 12.01; 99% of all carbon is carbon-12
