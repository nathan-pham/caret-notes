# Configuration Rules
## The Aufbau Principle
**Aufbau principle**: with electron configuration, electrons are placed in orbitals, subshells, and shells in order of increasing energy

## The Pauli Exclusion Principle
two atoms that share and orbital have opposite spins 

## Hund's Rule
electrons will always occupy empty orbitals if one is available
electrons will occupy orbitals alone and only pair if necessary
