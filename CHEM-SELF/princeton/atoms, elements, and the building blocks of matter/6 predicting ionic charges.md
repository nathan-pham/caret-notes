# Predicting Ionic Charges
stable configuration and energy level = outermost shell is filled
- for the s & p blocks it means 8 electrons in the outer shell
- **valence electrons**: outermost electrons

electrons close to full energy (halogens) are extremely reactive and gain electrons to achieve a more stable configuration

**ion**: atom that has gained or lost electrons
- **anion**: negatively charged ion
- **cations**: positively charged ions

all transition metals lose electrons -> cations (but how many is variable depending on the compound they are in)
- charge is indicated by the parenthesis
- zinc: always forms ions with a charge of +2
- silver: always forms ions with a charge of +1

- ex) CuBr2 contains 1 copper (II) and 2 bromide
- ex) CuBr contains 1 copper and 1 bromide

all transition metals will lose s-electrons before d-electrons

## Names and Theories
### Dalton's Elements
(1800s) John Dalton creates the foundation of atomic theory
1. **law of constant composition**: elements combine to form compounds and remain in the same ratio regardless where the compound originated from
2. **law of conservation of mass**: atoms are conserved in chemical reactions

### Development of the Periodic Table
(1869) Dmitri Mendeleev and Lothar Meyer independently arranged the elements into a primitive periodic table

### Thomson's Experiment
(1880s) J J Thomson observed the deflection of charges from a cathode ray tube
- indicated atoms were composed of positively and negatively charged particles
- assumed the atom was like a plum pudding, all mixed throughout

### Millikan's Experiment
Robert Millikan calculated an electron's charge by observing oil drops in an electric field 

### Rutherford's Experiment
(1900s) Ernest Rutherford fired alpha particles at gold foil and observed how they were scattered
- indicated positive charges clustered in the center (the nucleus) and atoms were mostly empty space

### The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
Werner Heisenberg said it was impossible to know the instantaneous position and momentum of an electron
- electron orbitals are not defined paths; they describe the probability of the existence of an electron in an area of space
