# Deviations From Ideal Behavior
gasses may have unexpected behavior at low temperature/high pressure
kinetic molecular theory falls apart when gas molecules are packed too closely
1. volume of gas becomes significant (actual volume of gases under non-ideal conditions > what is predicted by ideal gas equation since it doesn't factor in volume)
2. gas molecules will exhibit intermolecular attractions (real pressure will be < what is predicted by ideal gas equation since molecules will stick together and bounce around less)
  - stronger IMFs or more electrons -> more deviations
  - ex) helium has few IMFs and electrons and will not deviate much from ideal behavior when compared to argon
