# Maxwell-Boltzmann Diagrams
shows range of velocities for gas molecules (not all molecules will be moving at the same speed)
average velocity of molecules -> temperature

temperature is directly proportional to kinetic energy
higher temperature gas -> larger range for velocity -> increased kinetic energy

three curves representing nitrogen gas at 100K, 300K, and 500K
- variable kinetic energy (different temperatures)

three curves representing different velocity ranges for different gases at 300k
- same total kinetic energy (same temperature)
- He: least mass, less kinetic energy needed to make it move faster
- Xe: most mass, most kinetic energy needed to make it move faster
