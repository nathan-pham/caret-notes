# Maxwell-Boltzmann Diagrams
shows range of velocities for gas molecules (not all molecules will be moving at the same speed)
average velocity of molecules -> temperature

temperature is directly proportional to kinetic energy

higher temperature gas -> larger range for velocity -> increased kinetic energy
