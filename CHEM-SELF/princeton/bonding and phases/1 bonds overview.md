# Bonds Overview
chemical reactions utilize bonding to help atoms become stable
- **bonding**: transfer or sharing of electrons
- atoms are usually most stable with 8 electrons in the valence shell

## Ionic Bond
ionic substances are held together with electrostatic forces in a lattice structure

common trends with ionic bonds:
- forms between metals and non-metals
- solid at room temperature; high melting/boiling point

melting point is affected by charge and size (Coulomb's Law)
greater charge = greater bond energy (lattice energy)
- ex) MgO (charges +2 and -2) has a higher melting point than NaCl (charges +1 and -1)

smaller solids = greater bond energy; size is inversely proportional to bond energy
- ex) LiF has a greater melting point than KBr

electrons are localized around an atom and do not shift in the lattice structure
- poor conductors of electricity
- ionic liquids can conduct electricity because the ions can move around

## Metallic Bonds
valence electrons are mobile and delocalized:
- malleable and ductile
- good conductors of electricity

alloys: metals bonded with each other (typically as a liquid and then cooled)
**interstitial alloy**: combine metal atoms with different radii  
- ex) steel; the much smaller carbon occupies the interstices of iron 

**substitutional ally**: combine metal atoms with similar radii
- ex) brass; zinc is infused with copper

## Covalent Bonds
atoms share electrons with each other to complete their valence shells

sigma (σ) bond: first, single covalent bond
pi (π) bond: additional covalent bonds; stronger and shorter than single bonds

## Internuclear Distance
hydrogen atoms bond with each other when potential energy = minimum
- hydrogen atoms close: potential energy skyrockets (nuclei repel)
- hydrogen atoms far: potential energy = 0 (nucleus cannot attract electrons)
- minimum potential energy = repulsive and attractive forces are balanced

0 potential energy is not always the lowest potential energy
**covalent bonds will always form at minimum potential energy**

## Network (Covalent) Bonds
network solids are held in a lattice = extremely hard, high melting/boiling point
electrons are localized like ionic solids; poor conductors

ex) carbon: diamond or graphite
- group 14 = 4 valence electrons; forms several covalent bonds

ex) silicon (SiO2 quartz)
- **doping**: adds impurity to lattice; insert atoms with more (**n-doping**) or less valence electrons (**p-doping**); increases conductivity
- n-doping: adds free-moving electrons
- p-doping: adds positively charged holes, attracts electrons
