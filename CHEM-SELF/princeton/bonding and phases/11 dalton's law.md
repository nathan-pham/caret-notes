# Dalton's Law
total pressure = pressure of partial pressures of individual gases of mixture
P total = Pa + Pb + Pc + ...

partial pressure is directly proportional to moles of gas present in the mixture
- ex) if 25% of the gas is helium, partial pressure due to helium will be 25% of the total pressure (called mole fraction or X)
