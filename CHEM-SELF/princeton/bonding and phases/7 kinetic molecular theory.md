# Kinetic Molecular Theory
assumes the gas is an "ideal gas"

1. kinetic energy is proportional to absolute temperature; greater temperature -> greater average kinetic energy of molecules
2. average kinetic energy is determined by absolute temperature, not the gas identity (different gases mixed together will have the same kinetic energy)
3. gas particle's volume is insignificant compared to the container's volume
4. there are no forces of attraction between gas molecules
5. gas molecules are in constant motion and will not lose energy with collisions (with neighboring molecules or the container)

average kinetic energy of a gas molecule
KE = 0.5 * mv^2
- m = mass of molecule (kg)
- v = speed of molecule (m/s)
- KE (J)
