# Ideal Gas Equation
PV = nRT
- P = pressure of gas (atm)
- V = volume of the gas (L)
- n = moles of gas
- R = gas constant, 0.0821 L * atm / mol * K
- T = absolute temperature of gas (K)

combined gas law (rewritten ideal gas equation), only applicable for constant number of moles

if volume is constant: pressure and temperature are directly proportional (as pressure increases, temperature increases)
**Boyle's Law**: temperature is constant; pressure and volume are inversely proportional (as volume increases, pressure decreases)
**Charles's Law**: pressure is constant; temperature and volume are directly proportional (as temperature increases, volume increases)
