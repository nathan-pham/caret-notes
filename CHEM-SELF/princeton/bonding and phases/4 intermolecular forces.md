# Intermolecular Forces
intermolecular forces (IMF) exist between covalently bonded substances
- must be broken to change phases
- ionic substances change phases by breaking individual ions, not intermolecular forces

## Dipole-Dipole Forces
polar molecules: positive end is attracted to the negative end
more polarity = larger dipole-dipole attraction (high melting and boiling points)
substances that only experience dipole-dipole attractions are typically weak (low melting and boiling points)
- gas or liquid at room temperature

## Hydrogen Bonds
special dipole-dipole attraction
positively charged hydrogen is drawn to negatively charged, electronegative elements of neighboring molecules (F, O, N)

much stronger than typical dipole-dipole attraction because the H is unshielded
- high melting and boiling points
- causes water to be more dense as a liquid because hydrogen bonds form expanded crystal structures in solids

## London Dispersion Forces
occurs between all molecules
extremely weak; result of random electron motions on atoms
ex) nonpolar molecule might have slightly more electrons on one side, giving it instantaneous polarity 

molecules with more electrons have greater London dispersion forces, high melting and boiling points
substances that only experience London dispersion forces have low melting and boiling points

the effects of London dispersion forces can be assumed by looking at molar mass (greater molar mass = more protons = more electrons = more significant London dispersion forces)
- it is difficult to compare London dispersion forces between a nonpolar substance with many electrons and a polar substance with few electrons
- ex) Octane (boiling point of 125Â°C, nonpolar) has greater London dispersion forces than the hydrogen bonds in water (boiling point of 100Â°C, polar)

## Bond Strength
ionic substances are usually solid at room temperature
- boils and melts when solid lattice break
- energy based on Coulombic attraction between molecules

covalent substances are usually liquid at room temperature
- boils and melts when intermolecular forces break
- much lower boiling/melting point compared to ionic substances

metallic bonding is very strong (one type of atom): high melting points
- network covalent bonding is the strongest bond
- transition metals have the highest melting points

relative strength of intermolecular forces
1. hydrogen bonds
2. dipole-dipole attractions
3. London dispersion forces (temporary dipole, variable depending on molecular size -> number of electrons)

## Bonding and Phases
phase is related to intermolecular forces

substances with weak intermolecular forces -> gases (ie: N2)
substances with strong intermolecular forces -> liquids (ie: water)

ionic substances do not have intermolecular forces; phases are determined by ionic bonds in the lattice (significantly stronger than intermolecular forces) -> solid at room temperature
