# Lewis Dot Structures
## Drawing Lewis Dot Structures
1. x = count valence electrons in a molecule or polyatomic ion
2. if a polyatomic ion has a negative charge, add x electrons to the total;
   if a polyatomic ion has a positive charge, subtract x electrons from the total
3. draw the structure of the molecule and place two electrons between each pair of bonded atoms; the least electronegative atom goes in the center
4. add electrons until each atom has a complete outer shell
5. look at the central atom
   a. if the central atom electrons < 8, then remove an electron pair and add
     another bond between the outer atom and central atom
   b. if the central atom electrons = 8, then you are done
   c. if the central atom electrons > 8, then it is find unless electrons > 12

## Resonance Forms
When adding a double bond we can place it with any of the oxygen atoms because the strength of the single bonds in the carbonate ion are the same

relative length & strength in a resonance structure
- single bond = bond order of 1
- double bond = bond order of 2
- ex) carbonate ion has a bond order of (1 + 2 + 1) / 3 = 1.33

## Incomplete Octets
some atoms are stable with less than 8 electrons in the outer shell
- ex) hydrogen and helium (helium never bonds) requires 2 electrons
- ex) boron is stable with 6 electrons
- all other atoms need at least 8 electrons to be considered stable

## Expanded Octets
molecules with d subshells can have > 8 valence electrons but always < 12
- n = 3 and greater can have expanded octets
- n = 2 (C, N, O) cannot

allows noble gases to form bonds with d-orbitals

## Formal Charge
there can be multiple Lewis structures for molecules
formal charge indicates the more likely structure
- valence electrons - assigned electrons should = 0 (or net charge in polyatomic ions)
- fewer atoms with formal charge = more likely

ex) CO2

## Molecular Geometry
electrons repel each other; molecule will keep electron pairs far apart
**valence shell electron-pair repulsion (VSEPR) model**: predicts geometry

central atom form standard **hybrid orbitals**
- electron pairs determine the shape
- variations in shape are caused by number of bonds and lone pairs of electrons on the central atom

double and triple bonds are treated the same in predicting geometry
- multiple bonds have more repulsive strength and should technically have more space than the single bonds
- lone electron pairs have slightly more repulsive power compared to bond pairs (decreases bond angles)

2 electron pairs: _sp_ hybridization, linear shape

3 electron pairs: _sp2_ hybridization, trigonal planar shape (bond angles 120°)
![](..\..\.pastes\2021-07-25-16-18-51.png)

4 electron pairs: _sp3_ hybridization, tetrahedral shape (bond angles 109.5°)
![](..\..\.pastes\2021-07-25-16-19-50.png)

5 electron pairs: trigonal bipyramidal shape

6 electron pairs: octahedral
