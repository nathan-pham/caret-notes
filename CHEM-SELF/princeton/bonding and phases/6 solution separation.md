# Solution Separation
knowledge of intermolecular forces and Coulombic attractions can help separate substances from each other

## Solutes and Solvents
**like dissolves like**
- polar solvents (water) will dissolve polar and ionic solutes (salt)
- **dissociation**: ionic substance dissolves into individual ions called **electrolytes** (can conduct electricity

more ions in ionic compound = more conductivity
- ex) disassociated magnesium chloride -> Mg^2+ and 2 Cl^- has greater conductivity than disassociated sodium chloride -> Na^+ and Cl^-

## Paper Chromatography
**chromatography**: separation of a mixture by passing it through a medium
- not to be confused with **electrophoresis**, which passes it through a field

paper chromatography: uses paper as the medium through which components move through at different rates because of their polarity
- most useful for colored substances
- having colorless components is a limitation of this method

separation of pigments in black ink
1. paper is suspended over a solvent
2. ink is placed on the bottom of a filter paper
3. ink substances will be attracted to the polar water molecules as the solvent climbs paper (more attracted to water -> further it will travel up the paper)

retention (retardation, Rf) factor: distance the ink travels along the paper
Rf = distance traveled by solute / distance traveled by solvent front

conclusion: red is the most polar, greatest Rf factor and blue is the least polar

other solvents can be used with paper chromatography
- nonpolar solvents like cyclohexane would reverse the results (polar substances would be far less attracted)

## Column Chromatography
column is packed with a stationary substance
target solution (analyte) is injected into the column
another solution (eluent) is injected into the column; can be liquid or gas

as the eluent passes through the stationary phase, analyte will be attracted to it with various degrees of strength
- based on polarity, more polar -> travel through column faster
- similar to how solute is drawn up with the solvent in paper chromatography

## Distillation
distillation leverages different boiling points to separate them
- ex) water has a BP of 100°C and ethanol has a BP of 78°C
  heating a mixture of water and ethanol to over 80°C will cause the ethanol to vaporize (which can be collected with a condenser)
- works independent of color
- limited with mixtures containing substances with unknown boiling points
