# Polarity
atoms with covalent bonds can share electrons equally (nonpolar covalent) or unequally (polar covalent)
- higher electronegative atoms exert greater pull on electrons
- ex) fluorine atom as a stronger pull compared to a carbon atom

**dipoles**: area of negative or positive charge based on the probability the electron will be found around a particular atom

- fluorine has a negative dipole
- carbon has a positive dipole

nonpolar covalent bonds form between two identical atoms (like Cl2)

## Molecular Polarity
entire molecules can be polar
- depends on the polarity of individual bonds & (more importantly) geometry
- molecules composed of different atoms and with lone pairs on the central atom usually results in asymmetrical geometry -> polar

since the least electronegative atom is usually in the center of a Lewis structure, it is usually a positive dipole (the exception is hydrogen because its electronegativity is so low it will always be a positive dipole)

ex) tetrachloride CCl4 is nonpolar
even though individually the bonds are polar, the electrons are equally shared because the molecule is shaped in a way where the dipoles cancel

ex) BrCl4- is nonpolar (geometry overrides the lone pairs)
