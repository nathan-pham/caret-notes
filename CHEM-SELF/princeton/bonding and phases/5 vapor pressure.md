# Vapor Pressure
molecules in liquids are always moving; with enough kinetic energy they can break free from intermolecular forces and transition into gases

boiling: heat energy increases kinetic energy of molecules until all intermolecular forces are broken
vaporization: no additional energy needed, temperature and vapor pressure are directly proportional
- liquids with stronger intermolecular forces have lower vapor pressure
