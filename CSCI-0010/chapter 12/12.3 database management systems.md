# 12.3 Database Management Systems
**database**: structured set of data

**database management system (DBMS)**
- physical database: files that store the data
- database engine: allows user to access and modify database contents through specialized **query** languages
- database schema: specification of the structure of stored data; shows data relationships regardless on how the data is stored

## The Relational Model
**relational model**: organizes items and relationships with **tables**
- each table has a collection of **records (database entities)**
- each record has a collection of related **fields (attributes)**

database engine interacts with the user, schema, and database files

**key** field: unique identifier, does not need to be consecutive

| MovieID | Title       | Genre         | Rating |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 105     | Alien       | sci-fi horror | R      |
| 106     | Unbreakable | thriller      | PG-13  |
| 5022    | Elizabel    | drama period  | R      |

schema: `Movie(MovieID:key, Title, Genre, Rating)`

## Relationships
tables represent relationships among different objects
versatility is defined by how tables can link together

## Structured Query Language
**structured query language (SQL)**: primary relational database language
- specify database schema
- add, modify, delete, and query database content

not case sensitive, space delimited

(1970s) Sequal was developed by IBM
(1986) the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publishes the SQL standard

### Queries
select _attribute list_ from _table list_ where _condition_
- ex) `SELECT Title FROM Movies WHERE Rating = "R"`
- ex) `SELECT * FROM Movies WHERE Rating = "R" ORDER BY Title`
- use `*` to select all attributes

### Modifying Database Content
`insert`, `update`, and `delete` 

```sql
INSERT INTO Movies (MovieID, Title, Genre, Rating)
VALUES (0001, "Attack on Titan", "anime", "R")
```
insert statements that insert values into all columns can omit the columns entirely
specifies the attributes of a new record

```sql
UPDATE Movies SET Genre = "fantasy" WHERE Title = "Attack on Titan"
DELETE from Movies WHERE Title = "Attack on Titan"
```

## Database Design
**entity-relationship (ER) modeling**: popular database design technique
- **ER diagram**: graphical representation of types, attributes, relationships, etc.
- different shapes represent different entities; rectangles = records, ovals = fields, diamonds = relationships

**cardinality constraint**: restricts the number of relationships that can exist
- one-to-one (ie: one customer can rent many movies)
- one-to-many
- many-to-many
