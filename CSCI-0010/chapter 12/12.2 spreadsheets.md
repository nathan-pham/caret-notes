# 12.2 Spreadsheets
**spreadsheet**: software application based on **cells** containing data or a formula 
- referenced by column (letter) and row (number)
- ex) A1, C7

most spreadsheets allow for stylistic flexibility and user preferences (font size, color, alignment of data, decimal places, grid lines)

## Spreadsheet Formulas
dynamic; easily modified and expanded to accommodate more data in a similar format 

formulas are prefixed by `=`
- ex) `=E9/COUNT(E4..E8)`
- ex) `=SUM(C4..E$)`

supports basic arithmetic and **spreadsheet functions** that interact with cells 
**range**: defines a row or column of cells with two dots (`..`)

maintains data/formula relationships even when data is copy & pasted

## Circular References
**circular references**: cannot resolve results; formulas rely on each other
- ex) B15 = D22 + D23
  D22 = B15 + B16
  
## Spreadsheet Analysis
immense versatility in data representation and relationships
- ex) cost-benefit, break-even, projected sales
- all things business

**what-if analysis**: analysis of data based on assumptions
- ex) What if the number of attendees decreased by 10%?
- ex) What if the ticket price increases by $5?

### Spreadsheet Visualizations
visual approach to analyzing large amounts of data
- graphs: line charts, pie charts
- different types of graphs convey information in different ways
