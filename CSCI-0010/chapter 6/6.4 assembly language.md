# 6.4 Assembly Language
**assembly languages**: assign mnemonic letters to machine-language instruction (instead of binary or hex digits)
- more efficient and less error prone
- easier to remember "ADDA" (add value to A register) than opcodes ("0110")

**assembler**: reads assembly code and translates it to machine language
- different types of computers have different machine languages
- as many assembly languages and translators as there are CPUs

## Pep/9 Assembly Language
operands are specified by 0x and addressing mode (intermediate or direct)

**assembler directives** or _pseudo-operations_: instructions to assembler

**comments**: text written for human readers but are ignored by the assembler; starts with a semicolon (`;`)

source code in assembly language  -> object or machine code
_listing_: formatted version of the program containing memory addresses & object code

characters to be printed are stored into memory with the .ASCII directive

## Number Data, Branches, and Labels
output for Pep/9 is defined for characters; arithmetic would require input characters to be casted into numbers (and vice versa to create output)
- utility instructions help perform I/O with numbers and entire strings

**branch** instructions; let programmer decide which instruction to execute

`BR`: _unconditional branch_, causes program counter to be set to the memory address of the operand; interrupts linear sequence and jumps to another section within the program
- ex) branches over a section and skips to the real program

`BRLT` and `BREQ` are conditional operators
`CPWA` subtracts the operand from the accumulator value and stores the result in the accumulator (can be used in conjunction with conditional operators)

**labels**: put at beginning of line, similar to a function
- location can only be referenced by that label instead of memory address
- increases readability

## Loops in Assembly Language
basically create an internal counter and check if that counter has reached a specified limit with `BREQ` (end program, else loop to process more values)
