# 6.6 Testing
**test plan**: determine the correctness of a specific program
- documents the times and data a program must be able to solve
- should include the reason for choosing data, data values, and expected
- _test case_: set of input data values

**code coverage (clear-box testing)**: ensures each statement in program is executed; only looks at code
**data coverage (black-box testing)**: ensures limits of allowable data are covered; only looks at inputs
**test plan implementation**: runs test cases and compare results with expected values
- stop when test cases are complete & give the expected result
- quality of test cases is extremely important & must consider primary inputs
