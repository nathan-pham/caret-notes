# 6.1 Computer Operations
programming languages must mirror computer operations
computer: programmable electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process
- instructions that manipulate data are stored with data
- to change computer actions we change the instructions (with programming)

control unit actions:
- store data into memory
- retrieve data from memory
- process data in a meaningful way in the ALU

process: performing arithmetic and logical operations on data values
there are instructions that specify input - CPU and CPU - output interactions
actions computers can perform: store, retrieve, and process
