# 6.5 Expressing Algorithms
**algorithm**: plan for a solution
**pseudocode**: express algorithms in simpler form

## Pseudocode Functionality
hypothetical shorthand-like language used to express actions
no defined grammars but it must encapsulate certain concepts

###  Variables
refer to places in memory where values are stored
name should reflect algorithm content

### Assignment
putting a value into a variable

```
sum <- 1
sum <- sum + num
```

_expression_: composed of variables and operators

### Input/Output
`write`: output
`read`: input

```
write "Enter the numbers of values to read and sum"
read num
```

### Conditional Execution
selection allows you to add choices to a course of action

```
if sum < 0:
  print "error message"
else:
  print sum
  
// whatever comes next
```

indentation helps express logical ideas, execution eventually returns to the non-indented statements
`//` is used as a comment and is not part of the algorithm

### Repetition
allows instructions to be repeated

```
while counter < limit
  read num
  sum <- sum + num
  counter <- counter + 1
```

**boolean expression**: evaluates to true or false
- if true -> indented block is executed

## Following a Pseudo Algorithm
```
while (quotient is not zero)
  divide the decimal number by the new base
  remainder <- next digit to left of answer
  quotient <- decimal number
```

```javascript
const convert = (number, target_base) => {
  let quotient = number
  let remainders = []

  while(quotient > 0) {
    remainders.push(quotient % target_base)
    quotient = Math.floor(quotient / target_base)
  }

  return remainders.join('')
}

console.log(convert(93, 8))
```
