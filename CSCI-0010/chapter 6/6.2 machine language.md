# 6.2 Machine Language
**machine language**: programming instructions computers can execute
processors are integrated with machine instructions assigned to a binary code

most programs aren't written in machine language because it is inefficient 
- all languages are eventually compiled into machine language

## Pep/9: A Virtual Computer
each CPU has its own unique machine code
**virtual computer**: hypothetical machine with core features
Pep/9: created by Stanley Warford; 40 machine-language instructions

### Basic Features of Pep/9
65,536 bytes of storage
- each byte contains 8 bits
- describe bit pattern in a byte with two hexadecimal digits
- word length of 16 bits (length of information going into ALU)

_register_: small area of storage in ALU containing data (intermediate values)
- program counter (PC): address of next instruction to be executed
- instruction register (IR): copy of instruction being executed
- accumulator (A): data and results of operation
- Pep/9 contains 7 registers 

addresses name memory, they are not stored in memory
- address (location of byte) is not value

largest decimal value in a byte is 255 
- binary: 11111111 
- hexadecimal: FF

largest decimal value in a word (16 bits) is 65535
- binary: 1111111111111111
- hexadecimal: FFFF

positive & negative numbers loses a bit for sign
- hexadecimal: -7FFF to +7FFF
- decimal: -32,767 to +32,767

### Instruction Format
parts of an instruction:
- 8-bit  _instruction specifier_: indicates which operation will be executed
- 16-bit  _operand specifier_ (optional): holds operand or address of operand
- instructions may be 1 or 3 bytes depending on the necessity of an operation specifier

_operation codes (opcodes)_: 4- 8 bits long
- 5th bit: register specifier
  - value of 0 indicates accumulator (A register)

_addressing mode specifier_: 3 bits, describes how to interpret operand specifier
- _immediate (i) (000)_: operand specifier contains a data value (operand)
- _direct (d) (001)_: operand specifier contains a memory address

_unary instructions_: no operand specifier, no operand (data to be manipulated)

## Input and Output in Pep/9
simulates character input and character display
_memory-mapped I/O_: design principle; wires input and output devices to fixed main memory addresses
- Pep/9 input: FC15
- Pep/9 output: FC16

read character from input: load value from input to accumulator
write character to output: load character into accumulator and store it to the output device address

Pep/9 uses ASCII; each character is represented by one byte
- uses load byte and store byte operations to perform character I/O
- other systems may manipulate full word
