# Roles of an Operating System
**application software**: addresses real world problems (word processing programs, games, diagnostic tools, missile guidance)

**system software**: manages computer system, provides environment for application software
- **operating system**: core, manages hardware resources (memory, auxiliary devices), and supplies a (graphical) user interface
- includes core libraries like computer graphics

_booting_: computer hardware is wired to load instructions stored in ROM (which often load the operating system stored in secondary memory)
_dual-boot (multi-boot)_: a configuration that allows the user to choose between OSs (only one OS can control hardware at a given time)

popular OSs: Linux (personal version of UNIX), Windows, Mac OS
mobile OSs: Android (Open Handset Alliance and Google), iOS (derivative of Mac OS)

## Memory, Process, and CPU Management
**multiprogramming**: multiple programs in main memory compete for the CPU
**memory management**: tracks programs in memory and their location

**process**: program in execution
**process management**: tracks the progress of a process and its intermediate states (to mitigate the damage of an interrupted process)

**CPU scheduling**: determines which process will be executed by the CPU

OS is a program that is also executed by the CPU

## Batch Processing
(1960s) humans would operate giant computers
by inputting punched card programs and receiving a printed output

_job_: program and system instructions
the operator would load similar jobs (resource-wise) from many users into batches that could be scheduled onto the CPU
- obsolete in modern computing
- batch: programs and system resources coordinated and executed (`.bat` files, system commands)

## Timesharing
**timesharing**: allows many users to interact with a computer at the same time by making an instance of a **virtual machine** for each user

**mainframe**: a single, fast, core computer, contains the actual operating system
**dumb terminals**: connect to the mainframe and provides a display and keyboard 
- _login process_: represents each user logged into the mainframe (too many active users will slow the CPU's capacity)

## Other OS Factors
mainframes 
-> minicomputers 
-> _microcomputers_: single integrated chip CPU
-> _personal computer_ (PC) & _workstations_

operating systems support multi-device communication by installing device drivers

**real-time system**: operating systems optimize **response time** to user
