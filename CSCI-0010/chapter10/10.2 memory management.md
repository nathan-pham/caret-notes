# 10.2 Memory Management
all programs and referenceable data is stored in continuous main memory
- divided by 8, 16, or 32 bits
- every byte or word has a location address

operating system must
1. track where the program is
2. convert logical program addresses (variables) into memory addresses

**logical address (virtual or relative address)**: specifies a location relative to the program, not absolute to main memory
- increased flexibility; allows program to be moved around and loaded elsewhere 

**physical address**: actual main memory address

compiling: maps identifiers to logical addresses
loading: maps logical addresses to physical addresses via **address binding**

## Single Continuous Memory Management
operating system is given required space and program is allocated the rest
- only one program (not the OS) is loaded into a chunk of memory
- the location of the OS is the only important factor in binding addresses

knowing the starting point of the program will allow us to translate a logical, relative address into a physical, absolute address
- simple to implement
- wastes memory and CPU time

the application program is designed to go after the operating system to force it to stay within the bounds of main memory

## Partition Memory Management
load several applications at once; shares memory space and saves CPU time

**fixed-partition technique**: main memory is divided into a specific number of partitions
- after program terminates, the partition table must update 
- easier method to manage but limit types of programs (not enough space)

**dynamic-partition technique**: partitions accommodate the needs of a program
- empty partitions can be merged together to create large partitions with _compaction_

the OS tracks the start and length of each partition

CPU may use two special registers
- **base register**: beginning of partition
- **bounds register**: length of partition

the logical address 
1. compared to the bounds register to ensure the program fits within allocated memory 
2. added to the base register to make the physical address

partition selection:
- _first fit_: first available partition that is large enough to hold the program
- _best fit_: smallest available partition large enough to hold the program
- _worst fit_: largest available partition large enough to hold the program

first and best fit are fine for fixed partitions
worst fit is best for dynamic partitions

## Paged Memory Management
**page memory technique**: main memory is divided into **frames**; processes are divided into **pages**

pages are loaded into empty frames all around memory; must be tracked with a **page-map table (PMT)** for each process in memory
