# 7.2 Algorithms with Simple Variables
atomic variables cannot be divided
values stored in memory

## An Algorithm with Selection
top-level main module expresses tasks
```
print "enter the temperature"
read temperature
determine dress
```

selection -> conditional execution
```
// determine dress

if temperature > 90:
  print "Texas weather: wear shorts"
elif temperature > 70:
  print "Fair temperature: short sleeves"
else:
  print "Bruh stay inside"
```

## Algorithms with Repetition
loops can be count controlled or event controlled

### Count-Controlled Loops
uses a _loop control variable_ initialized to a starting value
loop stops when control variable meets specified condition
```
count = 0
while count < limit:
  count++
```

`while`: pretest loop, testing occurs before loop is executed
omitting the incrementation statement causes infinite loops 

### Event-Controlled Loops
event is initialized, tested, and updated
```js
const b = (number) => {
  let quotient = number
  let target_base = 2
  let remainders = []

  while(quotient > 0) {
    remainders.push(quotient % target_base)
    quotient = Math.floor(quotient / target_base)
  }

  return remainders.join('')
}
```

**nested structures**: control structures embedded into other structures

### Square Root
```js
const { prompt, print } = require("./utils")

const main = (async () => {
  while(true) {
    let square = Math.abs(new Number(await prompt("square > ")))
    let guess = square / 4
    let epsilon = 1

    while(epsilon > 0.001) {
      guess = (guess + (square / guess)) / 2
      epsilon = Math.abs(square - Math.pow(guess, 2))
    }

    print(guess)
  }
})()
```
