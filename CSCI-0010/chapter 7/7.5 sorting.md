# 7.5 Sorting
put array into order

## Selection Sort
1. while cards in original deck
2. find smallest card in original deck and append it to a new deck

## Bubble Sort
1. start with last element
2. compare successive elements, swap when bottom is smaller than the one above

extremely slow algorithm, requires several iterations

## Insertion Sort
enhanced bubble sort?
loop through array and "insert" misplaced elements in correct order
