# 7.1 How to Solve Problems
(1945) George Polya wrote _How to Solve It: A New Aspect of the Mathematical Method_, the standard description of the problem solving process
1. understand the problem
2. create a plan
3. implement the plan
4. reflect

## Ask Questions
_when_, _why_, _where_
annotate instructions & mark unclear areas
- what do I know?
- what are potential solutions?
- what are some special cases?
- how will I recognize I found the solution?

## Look for Familiar Things
repeat existing or successful solutions

## Divide and Conquer
break up larger problems into manageable pieces
divide tasks into subtasks

## Algorithms
**algorithm**: plan; a set of instructions for solving a problem with finite time and data

## Computer Problem-Solving Process
1. analysis and specification
2. algorithm development
3. implementation
4. maintenance

## Summary of Methodology
summary of the four steps

### 1. Analyze the Problem
list workable information or related data
specify possible solutions, format, assumptions

### 2. List the Main Tasks
_main module_: divide problem into functional areas
- introduce subparts if too much detail
- leave details for later

### 3. Write the Remaining Modules
refine modules until all statements are concrete

### 4. Re-sequence and Revise as Necessary
plan for changes
attempt and refine code to increase clarity

## Testing the Algorithm
checking results = testing process that got the answer
run programs under different conditions & analyze results
- only possible if program is complete
- can test prior to implementing
