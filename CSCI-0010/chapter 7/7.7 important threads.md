## Information Hiding
hiding low level details during design phase

## Abstraction
information hiding: hiding details
abstraction: result with details hidden, include only necessary details
- different views of the same concept

**data abstraction**: view of data; separate data from implementation
- bank may represent numbers in different number systems but it doesn't matter to me as long as the statements are accurate

**procedural abstraction**: separate action from implementation
- naming a subprogram

**control abstraction**: separate structures from implementation
- control structures alter flow of algorithm (`while` or `if`)

best method to handle complexity

## Naming Things
_identifiers_: concise phrases to represent tasks and data

## Testing
clear-box: based on code
black-box: testing all inputs
test plans often contain both types of testing at multiple levels
