# 7.4 Searching Algorithms

## Sequential Search
run through each item of array, stop if item is found

## Sequential Search in Sorted Array
[implementation](https://replit.com/@phamn23/sorted-search-array#index.js)
quite useless

## Binary Search
assumes array is sorted
eliminates half of array with comparisons, more efficient than sequential searches
