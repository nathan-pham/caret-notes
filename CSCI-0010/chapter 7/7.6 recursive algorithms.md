# 7.6 Recursive Algorithms
**recursion**: ability for an algorithm to call itself
alternative to looping

_best case_: we have an answer 
_general case_: solution in terms of calling itself, grows smaller until best is reached'

size factor: size of problem, must decrease with recursive calls

## Subprogram Statements
_calling unit_: name of code
- void subprograms: does a task, returns no value
- value-returning subprograms: does a task and returns a single value to calling unit

useful for abstraction

## Recursive Factorial
```js
const f = (n) => n == 0 ? 1 : n * f(n - 1)
```

## Recursive Binary Search
```
IF (first > last)
  RETURN FALSE
ELSE
  Set middle to (first + last) / 2
  IF (item equals data[middle])
    RETURN TRUE
  ELSE
    IF (item < data[middle])
      BinarySearch (first, middle â€“ 1)
  ELSE
      BinarySearch (middle + 1, last)
```
## Quicksort
developed by C. A. R. Hoare
sort two small lists than one large one
