# 2.2 Positional Notation
**base**: specifies the number of digits across the system
- ex) base 2 has two digits [0 - 1]
- ex) base 10 has ten digits [0 - 9]

**positional notation**: how numbers are written
- each digit represents a value multiplied by the base to the nth power
- represented as a polynomial with the base of the number system

ex) 943 = 900 + 40 + 3
where the base, x = 10
- 9 * x ^ 2 = 900
- 4 * x ^ 1 = 40
- 3 * x ^ 0 = 3

## Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal 
base 2: binary [0 - 1]
base 8: octal [0 - 7]
base 16: hexadecimal [0 - 15]

943 requires a base of 10 or higher, any bases lower means "9" does not exist
2074 requires a base of 8 or higher, any bases lower means "7" does not exist

bases higher than 10 use letters
- ex) base 16: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
