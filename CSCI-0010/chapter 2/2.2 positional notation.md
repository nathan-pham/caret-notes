# 2.2 Positional Notation
**base**: specifies the number of digits across the system
- ex) base 2 has two digits [0 - 1]
- ex) base 10 has ten digits [0 - 9]

**positional notation**: how numbers are written
- each digit represents a value multiplied by the base to the nth power
- represented as a polynomial with the base of the number system

ex) 943 = 900 + 40 + 3
where the base, x = 10
- 9 * x ^ 2 = 900
- 4 * x ^ 1 = 40
- 3 * x ^ 0 = 3

## Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal 
base 2: binary [0 - 1]
base 8: octal [0 - 7]
base 16: hexadecimal [0 - 15]

943 requires a base of 10 or higher, any bases lower means "9" does not exist
2074 requires a base of 8 or higher, any bases lower means "7" does not exist

bases higher than 10 use letters
- ex) base 16: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

## Arithmetic in Other Bases
other bases function the exact same way but may run out of carry digits sooner/later

## Power-of-2 Number Systems
binary and octal can be converted extremely easily due to the power of 2
- ex) 754 (octal) = 111 101 100 (binary)
                 7     5     4

## Converting Base 10 to Other Bases
1. take the decimal value & divide it by the new base, _n_
  - the remainder is the new digit in base _n_
2. repeat step 1. using the quotient as the "decimal value"

## Binary Values and Computers
modern computers operate on binary (which is easier to operate than decimal because 0 and 1 can be represented by low and high voltage)
**binary digit** (bit): smallest storage unit containing a 0 or 1
- 8 bits forms a **byte**
- bytes grouped together forms a **word**

_word length_: number of bits in a word
- 2 bytes or 16 bits: half words 
- 4 bytes or 32 bits: full words
- 8 bytes of 64 bits: double words

modern computers operate on 32-bit or 64-bit architecture
