Core i5: type of processor; runs at 2.5 GHz
- giga-hertz: measures cycles per second (in billions)
- _clock_: coordinates computer tasks; this CPU pulses 2.5 billion times per second
- trade-offs: faster processors may overheat or shut down

1066 MHz FSB: FSB pulses at 1066 million times per second
- _bus_: wires in which the processor can access memory and input/output devices
- _front-side bus_: primary bus that connects processor to auxiliary device
- trade-offs: auxiliary devices must also be faster

_6 MB cache_: _megabytes_ are a unit of memory of 2^20 bytes
- processors have direct access to embedded cache memory stores
- will only activate FSB if data is not within the cache (lazy load); FSB can be much slower than the processor
- trade-offs: bigger caches slow data access

display: _15.6 inch_ refers to the diagonal measurement
- _high definition (HD)_: compatible with HD television standard
- _light-emitting diode (LED)_: longer life, no mercury
- _1920 x 1080_: screen resolution in pixels (width x height)

Intel HD Graphics 520: graphics processor unit (GPU), more powerful than CPU
- keeps data for screen with on-board memory
- relieves main processor of graphics intensive tasks (image manipulation, games)

_random access memory (RAM)_: main memory
_synchronous, dynamic RAM (SDRAM)_: each byte of memory can be accessed directly, rather than sequentially traveling through memory
- _8 GB_: 8 x 2^30 bytes of storage
- _shared_: both processors have access to this memory
- _DDR3_: fastest speed at which memory can operate

HDD: secondary storage
- 1 TB (terabyte, 1 trillion bytes) of storage
- 5400 RPM (revolutions per minute): how fast disk spins, greater RPM means greater data transfer
- replaced by SSD

_solid-state disks_ (SSD): all-electronic, no data lost when power is turned off
- less power to operate, inherently much faster

DVD +/- RW drive: indicates how the drive can record on writeable DVDs
- +R and -R means the drive is compatible with all standards of disks
- DVD +/- R: write data once, infinite read
- DVD +/- RW: infinite write and read
- Blu-Ray: higher capacity, generally used for high-definition movies

802.11A, 802.11bgn, and Bluetooth wireless: describes networking capabilities
- 802.11: standard by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
  - four versions of the standard: a (initial), b (slight variation), g (long distances, slower speeds), n (long distances and greater speeds)
- Bluetooth: short range wireless network, connect auxiliary devices 

Intel RealSense 3D camera: built-in digital camera
- 3D: contains infrared sensors to capture distance -> facial & gesture recognition

metal lithium: high electrical storage capacity
- stronger batteries mean more capacity but at the cost of weight and size

_ports_: external connections, USB (universal serial bus) is for cable data transfer
- USB 3.0: third generation, high speed data transfer
- _high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI)_: send digital and audio 
- LAN 10/100: Ethernet connection for wired network access
- audio input/output: can connect headphones or microphone

_desktop replacements_: weight up to 8 pounds
Windows 10: operating system developed by Microsoft

time is expressed in powers of 10 because seconds are part of decimal
storage capacity is expressed in powers of 10 because byes are part of binary
