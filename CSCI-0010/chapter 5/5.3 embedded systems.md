# 5.3 Embedded Systems
computer (single microchip) designed to perform narrow range of functions 
all appliances with digital interfaces leverage embedded systems
- ex) watches, microwaves, cars, kitchen appliances, industrial control systems
- may be included within an OS or just specialized into a single program

initially were 8-bit microprocessors with onboard OS
modern: 32-bit digital signal processors (DSPs) and 64-bit RISC (reduced instruction set computer) chips

_embedded systems_: encompasses everything that is not a desktop PC
- first designs were physically embedded into a product
- refers more generally to preprogrammed chips part of a larger system
- features minimal user input (if any)

C programs are 25% larger and slower than assembly (but human readable)
assembly is often used for speed and size (hardware limitations)
