# 5.2 The Stored-Program Concept
_von Neumann architecture_ (1944-1945): data & instructions to manipulate data can be stored in the same place
- Neumann was a mathematician who worked on the atomic bomb
- originally conceived by J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly: worked on the ENIAC at University of Pennsylvania


## von Neumann Architecture

units that process are separate from units that store
- memory unit: holds data and instructions
- arithmetic/logic unit: capable of performing logical operations
- input unit: moves data from outside into the processor
- output unit: moves data from the processor to the outside
- control unit: manages all components

### Memory
_bit_: storage unit that can hold a 1 or 0
- 8 bits -> 1 byte
- bytes -> words

memory is a collection of cells with unique addresses
- _addressability_: a variable number of bits stored in an addressable location
- most computers are byte addressable

ex) 4 x 2^30 bytes of memory
- 4 GB is uniquely addressable
- addressability of this machine is 8 bits (256 cells of memory)

### Arithmetic/Logic Unit
**arithmetic/logic unit (ALU)**: performs
- arithmetic operations: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and subtracting
- logical operations: AND, OR, NOT, etc.

operates on words
- historically, word length -> the number of bits processed by the ALU
- Intel blurred this definition; the processor can also work on words

word: 16 bits
double words: 32 bits
quadwords: 64 bits

**registers**: immediate storage units containing 1 word
- much faster to access than memory locations

### Input/Output Units
**input unit** allows data and programs to be entered into the computer
- ex) first generation: paper tape or hole-punched cards
- ex) modern: keyboard, mouse, scanning devices

**output unit**: allows stored results to be displayed to the outside world
- ex) printers and displays

### Control Unit
**control unit**: organizes with the fetch-execute cycle
- **instruction register (IR)**: contains the instruction being executed
- **program counter (PC)**: contains the address of the next instruction

often combined with the ALU into the _central processing unit_ (**CPU**)

all components are connected by wires (_bus_)
buses carry addresses, data, and control
- address: select memory location or device to extract or input data
- data: flows over the bus between CPU, memory, and I/O devices
- control: manages flow of address & data; determines direction relative to CPU

**bus width**: number of bits that can be transferred simultaneously
**cache memory**: small fast-access memory that copies frequently used data
- CPU will check cache before accessing main memory
- much faster than memory accesses

**pipelining**: accelerate cycle by splitting instructions into overlapping steps
**motherboard**: printed circuit board containing computer components
- also contains ports to attach devices to the bus

_n_-bit processors: _n_ bits in the CPU registers
- 2 _n_-bit numbers can be added with a single instruction
- may refer to the width of the address bus (size of addressable memory)
- may refer to the width of the data width (number of bits that can move at once)

## The Fetch-Execute Cycle
computers can store, retrieve, and process data

processing cycle:
1. fetch next instruction
2. decode instruction
3. get necessary data
4. execute the instruction

### Fetch the Next Instruction
program counter (PC): contains address of the next instruction
control unit goes to address stored by the PC and places a copy of the contents in the instruction register (IR)
- IR contains the instruction to be executed
- PC must be updated before the current instruction is completed

instructions are stored contiguously; adding the bytes of the current instruction to the PC will return the address of the next instruction
- control unit often increments the PC
- executed instructions may change the PC

if additional memory is needed:
1. ALU sends address to memory bus
2. memory returns value of address
  - can be immediately manipulated or stored in a register
3. results from instructions are saved in registers or memory

### Decode the Instruction
control unit must determine what the instruction in the IR is before evaluation

instruction is decoded into control signals, computers can only execute instructions written in its machine language because the instructions are literally welded into circuits

### Get Data if Needed
instructions may require additional memory
- ex) add the contents of memory location to a register -> control unit must retrieve contents of that address

### Execute the Instruction
operands: data
control unit executes instruction by sending signals to the ALU
- ex) adding number to a register -> operand is sent to ALU and added to register

cycle restarts when execution is completed
von Neumann machine architecture has remained a basis of most computers

## RAM and ROM
_random-access memory (RAM)_: directly accessible and manipulatable memory 
- volatile, cannot retain configuration when power is shut
- 
_read-only memory (ROM)_: contents in ROM cannot be mutated or altered
- _burning_: embeds a bit pattern into the memory hardware
- used to store computer instructions (like booting sequence)

## Secondary Storage Devices
main memory is volatile and limited
_secondary (auxiliary)_ storage devices are additional components to memory
- technically an input and output device because they must support read and write
- must store large quantities of data (_mass storage devices_)

ex) 1 TB = 1000 x 2^30 bytes

### Magnetic Tape
_magnetic tape drive_: first mass auxiliary storage that could compete with permanent paper tapes and cards

![](..\..\.pastes\2021-06-29-16-48-54.png)

main disadvantages:
- accessing middle of tape causes all data before the piece to be discarded
- even if you can skip segments, it must physically move through read/write heads

### Magnetic Disks
_disk drive_: cross between disc player (heads) and tape recorder (magnetic storage)
- read/write head travels over a spinning magnetic disk
- information is stored magnetically

disk surfaces are organized into **tracks** and **sectors**
- sectors hold **blocks** of information (continuous bit sequence)
- locations of tracks and sectors are magnetically marked (not physically part of the disk)

![](..\..\.pastes\2021-06-29-16-55-01.png)

read/write head is on an arm that moves among the tracks
input/output instruction specifies he track & sector
- **seek time**: time it takes for read/write head to get in position
- **latency**: time it takes for sector to spin to read/write head
  - ~one-half the time for a full rotation
  - often called _rotation delay_
- **access time**: sum of seek time and latency
- **transfer rate**: rate at which data can be transferred from disk to memory

hard vs floppy disk (refers to literal flexibility of disk)
(1970s) first floppy disk created, 8" in diameter
- eventually reduced in size to 3 1/2" in diameter
- maximum capable of storing 1.44 MB
- replaced by flash drives

hard disks are composed of several disks or _platters_
- read/write heads hover above each platter
- platters line up into **cylinders**
- address: cylinder number, surface number, and sector
- rotate much faster than floppy drives
- ~7200 RPM (5400 RPM on laptops for energy conservation)
- high performance servers may have 15,000 RPM hard drives

### CDs and DVDs
_compact disc (CD)_: drives use a laser to read information on a plastic disk
- has a track that spirals from within (not concentric rings)
- broken into sectors; data is evenly spaced 
- transfer rate is consistent; rotation speed is dependent on laser position

suffixes attached to CD describe disk properties (formatting, mutability)
_compact disc-digital audio (CD-DA)_: good for timing information, each sector contains 1/75 a second of music
_CD-ROM_: same as CD-DA but disk is formatted differently and is read-only
- sectors contain 2 KB of data
- total maximum capacity of 600 MB

_CD-R (recordable)_: data can be written after it is manufactured
- immutable after data is changed

_CD-RW_: rewritable, can have data recorded multiple times

_digital versatile disk (DVD)_: large storage capacity, well suited for distributing multimedia with audio and video
- DVD+R & DVD-R: recordable, +/- describe competing formats (4.7 GB)
- DVD+RW: rewritable
- DL (prefix): _dual layer_, doubles DVD capacity (8.5 GB)

_DL Blu-Ray_ has 50 GB capacity (uses blue lasers instead of red lasers like CD and DVD drives)

`x` is used to rate CD and DVD speed of access relative to standard players
- listed speeds may be only referring to sections of disk and not the average

###  Flash Drives
(1998): flash drive introduced by IBM
- flash memory: R/W non-volatile computer memory
- used to build solid-state disks (SSDs)

all electronic: faster, less power consumption 
- can still wear down

## Touch Screens
_touch screen_: an I/O (input and output) device capable of displaying text and graphics but can also determine where the user is touching the screen
- useful for less complex input
- better protected than exposed keyboards

_resistive_ touch screen: made of a vertical lined layer and a horizontal lined layer separated by a small space
- when layers come into contact, electrical current can flow
- specific vertical/horizontal lines -> location of screen touch

_capacitive_ touch screen: laminate applied over glass screen
- laminate conducts electricity & a small current is applied on all 4 corners
- current flows to finger/stylus; location of touch is determined by strength of electricity flowing to each corner

_infrared_ touch screen: projects horizontal and vertical beams of infrared light
- breaking beams by touch screen allows us to determine location

_surface acoustic-wave (SAW)_: similar to infrared but uses high frequency sound saves

beam-based touch screens are compatible with gloves
