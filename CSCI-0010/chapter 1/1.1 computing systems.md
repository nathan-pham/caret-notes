# 1.1 Computing Systems
**computing system**: the dynamic interaction of hardware, software, and data used to solve problems
**computer hardware**: physical medium of a computing system
**computer software**: executable programs providing readable instructions 

## Layers of a Computing System
computing systems are organized into layers
**information**: conceptual management of information represented by binary digits, 0s and 1s
**hardware**: physical medium of the computer system
- includes gates & circuitry that control electricity flow
- increasingly specialized hardware components (central processing unit & memory)

**programming**: instructions to perform computations & manage data
- goal of all programming languages is to solve problems

**operating system**: manages computer resources
- ex) Windows, Mac OS, Linux

**application**: leverages computer to solve a given problem like designing a building or gam
- far-reaching, involves information systems, artificial intelligence, simulations, etc.

**communications**: computers network with each other to share information and resources, forming The Internet

## Abstraction
**abstraction**: simplified mental model
**information hiding**: eliminate the ability of a program to access information located elsewhere
- ensures programs are isolated, increasing modularity and reducing errors
- a design feature with abstraction at its core
