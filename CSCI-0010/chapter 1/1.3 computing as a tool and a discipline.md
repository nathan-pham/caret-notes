# 1.3 Computing as a Tool and a Discipline
computing is a discipline (low-level) or the discipline or computing has made their tools possible (applications built on applications)
_discipline_: field of study, the body of knowledge and practices used by professionals 
computer science: What can be automated? 
- _algorithmic thinking_: express problems in step-by-step procedures
- _representation_: store data in a processable way
- _programming_: combine algorithmic thinking and representation into computer software
- _design_: software has a useful intent

computer science encapsulates mathematics, science, and engineering
- Turing theorems: certain problems cannot be solved
- Boolean algebra: computer circuits 
- numerical analysis: scientific applications of computing
- science: scientific method can be implemented to test hypothesis (like bug hunting)
- engineering: build and design complex computing systems

## The Big Ideas of Computing
creativity: new mediums (visual graphics, audio, tactile)
abstraction: model the world & communicate to machines
data & information: management and interpretation of information
algorithms: allow us to develop solutions 
programming: implement the solutions
the Internet: mechanism for sharing & communicating
global impact: innovation
