# 3.4 Representing Audio Data
sound is defined by air compressions perceived by our vibrating ear drums

voltage signal varies in proportion to an analog sound wave to vibrate the air
sound can be digitized into discrete numeric values
_sampling_: periodically record the voltage signal and appropriate numeric value
- results in a series of voltage values
- can be used to form a continuous electronic signal 

looses some information
~ 40,000 samples per second is enough to recreate most sounds
- lower sample frequencies produce _distortion_
- higher sample frequencies are more accurate but may be irrelevant if the ear cannot perceive it

vinyl record albums are analog representations of sound with a rough spiral groove 
movement of the needle on the record player (turntable) is interpreted as voltage

CDs store sound digitally with microscopic pits representing binary digits
a low-intensity laser reflects of the surface and into a receptor
- smooth -> strong, pit -> weak
- receptor analyzes data -> binary -> numeric voltage values -> sound

## Audio Formats
popular: WAV, AU, AIFF, VQF, MP3
- based on samples from analog signals
- vary in data detailing and compression techniques
- MP3 is the most prevalent because of high support and compression ratio 

## The MP3 Audio Format
MP3: _MPEG-2, audio layer 3 file_
- MPEG: _Moving Picture Experts Group_
- international committee that creates digital audio and video compression standards

MP3 has lossy and lossless compression
1. analyzes frequency spread
2. discards information that is imperceptible to humans
3. bit stream is compressed with Huffman encoding
