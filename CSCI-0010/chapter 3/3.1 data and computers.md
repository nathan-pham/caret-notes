# 3.1 Data and Computers
**data**: basic values or facts, lacks structure and context
**information**: data organized and processed into a usable fashion

computers are **multimedia** devices capable of handling more than text and numbers (audio, images, videos)
- all data is stored as binary

**data compression**: reducing the amount of space needed to store data
- important because of hardware limitations & need to share content with others
- **compression ratio**: size of compressed data / size of original data, indicates the amount of compression (values closer to 0 have tighter compression)
- trade-offs between accuracy and size

**lossless**: data is compressed without loosing information
**lossy**: data is lost as part of the compression process

**bandwidth**: the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in a given time period

## Analog and Digital Data
**analog**: like nature, continuous and infinite
- directly proportional to the infinite world
- ex) mercury thermometer has an indicator that rises continuously in relation to the temperature

**digital**: computers are finite and must represent nature with discrete points because of limited memory
- **digitize**: to break up analog data into binary pieces 

electronic signals degrade because the environment may cause voltage to fluctuate
- information is lost immediately when analog signals degrade
- digital signals jump between two extremes (**pulse-code modulation**) separated by a middle threshold (more resilient to fluctuations)
  - digital signals are periodically **reclocked** to smooth out imperfections

## Binary Representations
more bits enables more possible representations
- ex) 2 bits -> 4 combinations (00, 11, 01, 10)
- _n_ bits can represent 2^n combinations
