# 3.1 Data and Computers
**data**: basic values or facts, lacks structure and context
**information**: data organized and processed into a usable fashion

computers are **multimedia** devices capable of handling more than text and numbers (audio, images, videos)
- all data is stored as binary

**data compression**: reducing the amount of space needed to store data
- important because of hardware limitations & need to share content with others
- **compression ratio**: size of compressed data / size of original data, indicates the amount of compression (values closer to 0 have tighter compression)
- trade-offs between accuracy and size

**lossless**: data is compressed without loosing information
**lossy**: data is lost as part of the compression process

**bandwidth**: the maximum number of bytes that can be transmitted in a given time period
