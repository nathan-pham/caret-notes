# 3.2 Representing Numeric Data
Numeric data is the most prevalent type of data because it does not require strict mapping and has a natural relationship with binary as number systems 
- mostly true for positive integers

## Representing Negative Values
### Signed Magnitude Representation
a sign (+ or -) is placed in front of a magnitude to indicate ordering
- if no sign is supplied, a positive sign is assumed
- values to the left of 0 are negative
- values to the right of 0 are positive

-0 and +0 adds unnecessary complexity for computers

### Fixed-Size Numbers
only allow a fixed number of values, where half are negative
the sign is determined by magnitude
- ex) 1 - 49 represent positive 1 to 49 and 50 - 99 represent negative numbers -50 to -1

carries are discarded

-(_I_) = 10 ^ k - _I_
- k is the number of digits
- ex) -(3) = 10 ^ 2 - 3 = 97
- referred to as **ten's complement**; computers use **twos complement**

## Two's Compliment 
Can use a similar formula to ten's complement
-(_I_) = 2 ^ k - _I_
- ex) -(2) = 2 ^ 8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254 
  254 in binary is 11111110
  therefore -(2) is 11111110
  
_sign bit_: the left most bit; 0 is positive, 1 is negative

the easier way to calculate two's compliment
1. invert all of the bits
2. add 1

### Number Overflow
**overflow**: computed value cannot fit into the allocated bits
- ex) adding 127 to 3 would produce an overflow that represents another value

## Representing Real Numbers
_real values_: any representable, non-integer values
- contain a whole part and a fractional part, either may be 0
- ex) in base 10: 10.99, 357.0,3.14159

the same rules as base 10 apply to base 2
the decimal point in base 2 is referred to as the **radix point**
- values right of the radix take the format 2 ^ -n where n is the index

in computers real numbers are represented by **floating point**
- sign (positive or negative)
- mantissa (made up of digits with the radix point to the right)
- the exponent (describes how far the radix point should be moved relative to the mantissa)

real values in base 10: sign * mantissa * (10 ^ exp)
- positive exponents move the decimal to the right
- negative exponents move the decimal to the left
- ex) 148.69 = 14869 * 10 ^ -2 

binary floating point is defined by: sign * mantissa * (2 ^ exp)

converting decimals to binary is similar to normal base 10 conversions (divide by the new base)
1. multiply the fractional component by the new base
2. repeat until the fractional component is 0
3. the resulting binary fraction is the combination of the whole numbers

ex) 0.75 to binary
  0.75 * 2 = 1.50
  0.50 * 2 = 1.0
  therefore 0.75 in binary is 0.11
  
ex) 20.25 to binary
  whole part:
    20 / 2 = 10  0r
    10 / 2 = 5  0r
    5 / 2 = 2  1r
    2 / 2 = 1  0r
    2 / 2 = 0  1r
    therefore 20 in binary is 10100
  fractional part:
    0.25 * 2 = 0.50
    0.50 * 2 = 1.0
    therefore 0.25 in binary is 01
  therefore 20.25 in binary is 10100.01
  
**scientific notation**: floating point representation with only 1 whole number
- ex) 12001.32708 = 1.200132708E+4
- "E" was used because exponents could not be displayed
