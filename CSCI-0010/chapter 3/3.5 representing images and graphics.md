# 3.5 Representing Images and Graphics

## Representing Color
perception of frequencies of light interpreted by our retinas
- eyes have color photoreceptor cone cells: red, green, and blue
- all colors are a combination of varying levels of these colors

as a result, color is expressed as RGB (red-green-value)
scale of 0 to 255; 0 means no color contribution and 255 means max color contribution 

RGB gives rise to _color space_

_color depth_: amount of data (bits) used to represent a color
- _high color_: 16-bit color depth
  - 5 bits are used for each RGB value
  - last bit represents transparency
- _true color_: 24-bit color depth
  - 8 bits are used for each RGB value (full range of 0 - 255)
  - 16.7 million unique colors, more colors than we can distinguish 
  - hardware may restrict the number of colors that can be displayed 

## Digitized Images and Graphics
photograph: continuous across with blends of colors
- digitizing requires individual, colored  **pixels** (picture elements)
- **resolution**: number of pixels
- higher resolution means more continuous looking images

**raster-graphics format**: pixel-by-pixel basis storage
- bitmap (BMP), GIF, and JPEG

_bitmap_: pixel colors from left to right & top to bottom 
- supports 24-bit true color
- can be compressed with run-length encoding 

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF): limits colors to 256
- _indexed color_: smaller file sizes with less colors
- made by CompuServe in 1987
- best for line art & small animations

JPEG: exploits the fact eyes are sensitive to gradual changes of brightness and color rather than rapid changes
- stores averages of color hues over short distances
- superior image format for photographs

PNG (ping): _Portable Network Graphics_
- designed to supplant GIFs
- greater compression, more color depths, and animation (APNG)

**metadata**: data about data, describes purpose & structure
- ex) date & time of creation, size, resolution
- ex) location, creator, copyright info

## Vector Representation of Graphics
describes images in terms of lines and geometric shapes instead of colored pixels like raster graphics
- describes line direction, thickness, and color
- generally smaller because complexity determines file size (it does not record every pixel)

raster graphics must be encoded -> differences in sizes & proportions
vector graphics can be resized dynamically
- bad for realistic images, good for line art & cartoons

_Scalable Vector Graphics_ (SVG): represented in plain text, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (WWWC)
