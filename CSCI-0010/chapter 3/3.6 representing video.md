# 3.6 Representing Video
complex information; difficult to capture & compress
essentially many sequential still images
quality depends on the level of compression or _video codes_

## Video Codes
_Codec_: _COmpressor/DECompressor_
**video codec**: methods used to shrink videos for transmitting
- most are lossy compression to minimize data
- generally block oriented; frames of the video are divided into rectangles and encoded 

**temporal compression**: diffs two sequential frames
- __keyframe_: basis on which to compare, entire image stored
- _delta frames_: changes that are stored
- most effective in scenes with little movement

**spatial compression**: removes redundant frame information (like run-length encoding)
1. groups pixels into blocks with the same color
2. stores color/coordinates of the area instead of individual pixels

popular video codecs: Sorenson, Cinepak, MPEG, Real Video
