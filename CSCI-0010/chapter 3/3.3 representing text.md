# 3.3 Representing Text
text documents (analog) are composed of characters (discrete, digital)
**character set**: a list of characters and codes to represent each
- predominant character sets are ASCII and Unicode

## The ASCII Character Set
ASCII: _American Standard Code for Information Exchange_
- originally had 7 bits representing 128 unique characters, the 8th bit serving as a **check bit** (ensures proper data transmission)
- was later extended to use all 8 bits representing 256 unique characters: _Latin-1 Extended ASCII character set_

the first 32 characters are reserved for special purposes, like return and tab

## The Unicode Character Set
ASCII was not powerful enough for international use
Unicode was designed to represent all symbols, including Asian characters and scientific symbols
- uses 16 bits per character
- flexible; can insert spaces to add more characters
- actually a superset of ASCII, allowing for backwards compatibility

## Text Compression
techniques to effectively store and transmit information
1. keyword encoding
2. run-length encoding
3. Huffman encoding

### Keyword Encoding
a text compression in which popular articles are reduced to a single character
(decoding would mean restoring the articles)

main limitations
- special characters in the original  cannot be used in the encoded document 
- common words like "a" wouldn't be replaced (no real benefit)
- capitalization matters; "The" and "the" would need different maps

encoded patterns focus on repeated suffixes, like "ex", "ing", and "tion"

### Run-Length Encoding
also called _recurrence coding_
sequences of repeated characters are replaced by a _flag character_, the repeated character, and the number of repeated characters
- ex) AAAAAAA = *A7

we could have representations of 0 - 255 in binary with 8 bits

### Huffman Encoding
uses variable bits to describe text (contrary to character sets)
1. use a few bits for frequent characters
2. reserve longer bits for infrequent characters

no bit representing a character is the prefix of any other character representation
1. scan across from left to right 
2. first match in the Huffman code is the character (no other possibility)

codes are generally based on frequency of characters in a document
