# 3.3 Representing Text
text documents (analog) are composed of characters (discrete, digital)
**character set**: a list of characters and codes to represent each
- predominant character sets are ASCII and Unicode

## The ASCII Character Set
ASCII: _American Standard Code for Information Exchange_
- originally had 7 bits representing 128 unique characters, the 8th bit serving as a **check bit** (ensures proper data transmission)
- was later extended to use all 8 bits representing 256 unique characters: _Latin-1 Extended ASCII character set_

the first 32 characters are reserved for special purposes, like return and tab

## The Unicode Character Set
ASCII was not powerful enough for international use
Unicode was designed to represent all symbols, including Asian characters and scientific symbols
- uses 16 bits per character
- flexible; can insert spaces to add more characters
- actually a superset of ASCII, allowing for backwards compatibility
