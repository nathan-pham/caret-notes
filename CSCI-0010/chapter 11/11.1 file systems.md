# File Systems
main memory: volatile, data and active programs
secondary memory: permanent data storage
- hard drives built with magnetic disks
- tape drives are used for archiving 

**file**: collection of related data, further organized into **directories**
- contains a program/data in a particular format
- sequence of organized bits

**file system**: view of directories and files

## Text and Binary Programs
**text file**: bytes of data are ASCII or Unicode
**binary file**: interpretation of bits based on file

the type of file refers to how the bits are formatted, all files are still stored as binary digits

_source file_: contains a high-level language 

## File Types
**file type**: refers to the kind of information stored in a document, indicated by the **file extension**

ex) `.java` represents Java source code

graphical user interface (GUI) displays images and icons to represent files and file types 

## File Operations
- create, delete, open, close, read, write, truncate, rename, or copy a file
- reposition file pointer in a file
- append data to end of file

files must be opened first to perform operations

open files have a pointer (address) indicating where the next read or write operation should happen; updates at the end of each operation
- read: OS copies data in file from file pointer
- write: data stored at location indicated by pointer

## File Access
sequential access (magnetic tape)
- linear structure file
- read and write move the pointer depending on amount of data

direct access (magnetic disk)
- files are divided into logical records
- allows user to set pointer to any record in any order; harder to implement but more useful in bigger data stores

files can be stored on any medium but the access technique define how the pointer can be positioned

## File Protection
OS ensures valid file access; determines who can access the file and for what purpose

ex) UNIX offers permissions that determine the type of operations a user can perform
- Owner: highest permissions
- Group: apply to users within a group
- World: anyone who has access
