# Disk Scheduling
speed of CPU and main memory > speed of data transfer with a secondary memory device

**disk scheduling**: algorithm determining which disk request to satisfy first

magnetic disk drive
  -> stack of platters 
    -> tracks 
      -> sectors
      -> cylinders (corresponding tracks, parallel concentric circles)
    
_seek time_: time it takes for head to reach cylinder
_latency_: time it takes for the platter to rotate

## First-Come, First-Served Disk Scheduling
FCFS: process requests in the original order
not efficient; heads will travel more than necessary if they skip over cylinders described later in the list

ex) 49, 91, 22, 61, 7
going directly from cylinder 91 to cylinder 22 will skip cylinder 61; inefficient


## Shortest-Seek-Time-First Disk Scheduling
SSTF: select "closest" cylinder; heads may change direction instead of linear progression

ex) 49, 91, 22, 61, 7, 62, 33, 35
starting cylinder of 26
visit 22, then 33, 35, 49, etc.

_starvation_: old requests are never satisfied and accumulate because new requests are always closer

## SCAN Disk Scheduling
similar to an elevator (only go up to one extreme, then reverse)

ex) 49, 91, 22, 61, 7, 62, 33, 35
starting cylinder of 26
cylinders move down to 1 and satisfy 22 & 7
cylinders revers direction and satisfy 33, 35, etc.

Circular SCAN: upon reaching one extreme, the heads switch to the other extreme instead of reversing direction

_LOOK_ disk scheduling: checks to see if heads should keep moving in the current direction
