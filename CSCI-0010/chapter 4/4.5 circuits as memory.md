# 4.5 Circuits as Memory
sequential circuits: existing state can be used to determine the next state
_S-R latch_: stores a single bit
- guarantees that the outputs are complements
- X is considered the current, stored state

circuit keeps state if S & R are 1
momentarily setting S to 0 and R to 1 causes X to become 1
momentarily setting R to 0 and S to 1 causes X to reset to 0
