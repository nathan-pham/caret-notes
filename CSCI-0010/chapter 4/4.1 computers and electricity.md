# 4.1 Computers and Electricity 
electronic signals have a level of voltage
- 0 to 2 volts is "low" -> binary 0
- 2 to 5 volts is "high" -> binary 1
- signals are constrained within one range

**gate**: performs operations based on electronic signal inputs
- accepts +1 input signals -> 1 output signal
- performs a specific logical function

**circuits**: combined gates; perform more complicated tasks
- designed to perform arithmetic, store values
- outputs of one gate can be fed into the input of another
- flow of electricity is controlled by logical gates

notational methods can be used to describe gate behavior
- boolean expressions
- logic diagrams
- truth tables

**Boolean algebra**: variables and functions can only take 0 or 1
- invented by English mathematician George Boole
- allow us to define and manipulate circuit logic mathematically

**logic diagram**: graphical representation of circuits
- gates (represented by icons) are linked to form a circuit

**truth table**: defines the function of a gate 
- lists all possible input combinations and otuput
