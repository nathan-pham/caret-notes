## Transistors
establishes how inputs map to outputs
**transistor**: acts depending on voltage level
- acts as a wire that conducts electricity or a resistor that blocks electricity
- **semiconductor**: neither good at conducting nor insulating (silicon)

(1947) Bell Labs: created second generation hardware with transistors
- less energy & maintenance to operate compared to vacuum tubes
- switch states within nanoseconds

electrical signals have a source (battery, outlet)
- _grounded_: electricity can flow into the ground, pulls down voltage to 0

transistors are composed of 3 terminals: source, base and emitter
- emitters are grounded
- source has a high voltage, ~ 5 volts
- the base can connect the source and ground
  - base signal is high, source is grounded (transistor off)
  - base signal is low, source stays high (transistor on)

output is connected to the source
simplest gates: NOT, NAND, and NOR

with base gates we can attach an inverter -> AND and OR gate
