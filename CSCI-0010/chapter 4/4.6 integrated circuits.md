# 4.6 Integrated Circuits
**integrated circuits** (_chip_): silicon inscribed with gates
- mounted to a plastic/ceramic package
- edges can be soldered onto circuit boards or placed into sockets
- pins connected to input/output of a gate or power/ground

ICs are classified by the quantity of gates

SSI chip contains a few independent gates
- ex) 14 pins (1 for power, 3 per gate)

gates on a VLSI chip are not independent; they are SSI
- extremely high gate-to-pin ratio
- multiplexers are an example of this circuit
