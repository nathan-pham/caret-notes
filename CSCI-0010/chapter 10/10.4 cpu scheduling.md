# CPU Scheduling
determines which ready process should be given to the CPU

**nonpreemptive scheduling**: a terminating program or a running process switching to the waiting state triggers a scheduling decision

**preemptive scheduling**: a waiting program switching to the ready state or a running program switching to ready state triggers a scheduling decision

**turnaround time**: time between when a process enters ready state and then terminates

## First Come, First Served
FCFS: processes are moved to the CPU in sequential ordering; nonpreemptive

Gantt chart shows order and time of process cycle
- average turnaround time: (140 + 215 + 535 + 815 + 940) / 5 = 529, assumes each process arrives at the same time
- turnaround time: completion time - arrival time, assumes processes do no not arrive at the same time (real life)

easily implemented but inefficient

## Shortest Job Next
SJN: looks at all ready programs and dispatches the smallest service time program; nonpreemptive

another Gantt chart; because selection criteria differs, process completion greatly differs
average turnaround time: 435

must estimates the execution time given the job type and probability; you cannot see the future to see the smallest service time program
- referred to as _provably optimal_; it would produce the shortest turnaround time if we knew the future

## Round Robin
equally distribute process time among ready processes; cycles through each process for a given time until all processes are complete

**time slice (quantum)**: amount of time each process gets before it is returned to ready state

Gantt chart using a time slice of 50 (unless the program is smaller)

average turnaround time: 668
likely the most widely used because it adapts well to most jobs
