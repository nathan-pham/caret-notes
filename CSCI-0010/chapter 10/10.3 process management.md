# 10.3 Process Management
## The Process States

![](..\..\.pastes\2021-07-16-13-04-09.png)
- _new state_: process is created 
- _ready state_: no barriers to execution; waiting to use CPU
- _running state_: currently being executed
- _waiting state_: waits for resources (like for a page swap from secondary memory)
- _terminated state_: execution is complete; OS disposes of process and related information

only one process can run at a given moment

## The Process Control Block
**process control block (PCB)**: where data is stored for a particular active process
- represents each state; follows the lifecycle

stores process information
- program counter, which indicates which instruction will be executed next
- all other CPU register values
- CPU scheduling (process priority)
- memory management information (base and bound registers or page tables)
- account information, time limits, execution time

**context switch**: exchange of information between the PCB <- CPU registers and running state -> CPU registers
